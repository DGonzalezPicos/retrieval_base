The method assumes a balance between turbulent diffusion and sedimentation in horizontally uniform cloud decks. Calculations for the Jovian ammonia cloud are compared with results from previous methods. An adjustable parameter describing the efficiency of sedimentation allows the new model to span the range of predictions made by previous models. Calculations for the Jovian ammonia cloud are consistent with observations. Example calculations are provided for water, silicate, and iron clouds on brown dwarfs and on a cool extrasolar giant planet. We find that precipitating cloud decks naturally account for the characteristic trends seen in the spectra of L- and T-type ultracool dwarfs.},

  abstract = {While radial velocity surveys have demonstrated that the population of gas giants peaks around 3 au, the most recent high-contrast imaging surveys have only been sensitive to planets beyond {$\sim$}10 au. Sensitivity at small angular separations from stars is currently limited by the variability of the point-spread function. We demonstrate how moderate-resolution integral-field spectrographs can detect planets at smaller separations ({$\lessequivlnt$} 0.3``) by detecting the distinct spectral signature of planets compared to the host star. Using OSIRIS (R {$\approx$} 4000) at the W.M. Keck Observatory, we present the results of a planet search via this methodology around 20 young targets in the Ophiuchus and Taurus star-forming regions. We show that OSIRIS can outperform high-contrast coronagraphic instruments equipped with extreme adaptive optics and non-redundant masking in the 0.05``--0.3`` regime. As a proof of concept, we present the 34{$\sigma$} detection of a high-contrast M dwarf companion at {$\approx$}0.1`` with flux ratio of {$\approx$} 0.92\% around the field F2 star HD 148352. We developed an open-source Python package, breads, for the analysis of moderate-resolution integral-field spectroscopy data in which the planet and the host star signal are jointly modeled. The diffracted starlight continuum is forward-modeled using a spline model, which removes the need for prior high-pass filtering or continuum normalization. The code allows for analytic marginalization of linear hyperparameters, which simplifies the posterior sampling of other parameters (e.g., radial velocity, effective temperature). This technique could prove very powerful when applied to integral-field spectrographs such as NIRSpec on the JWST and other upcoming first-light instruments on the future Extremely Large Telescopes.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Measuring the metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio in exoplanet atmospheres is a fundamental step towards constraining the dominant chemical processes at work and, if in equilibrium, revealing planet formation histories. Transmission spectroscopy (for example, refs.               1,2               ) provides the necessary means by constraining the abundances of oxygen- and carbon-bearing species; however, this requires broad wavelength coverage, moderate spectral resolution and high precision, which, together, are not achievable with previous observatories. Now that JWST has commenced science operations, we are able to observe exoplanets at previously uncharted wavelengths and spectral resolutions. Here we report time-series observations of the transiting exoplanet WASP-39b using JWST's Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam). The long-wavelength spectroscopic and short-wavelength photometric light curves span 2.0--4.0\,micrometres, exhibit minimal systematics and reveal well defined molecular absorption features in the planet's spectrum. Specifically, we detect gaseous water in the atmosphere and place an upper limit on the abundance of methane. The otherwise prominent carbon dioxide feature at 2.8\,micrometres is largely masked by water. The best-fit chemical equilibrium models favour an atmospheric metallicity of 1--100-times solar (that is, an enrichment of elements heavier than helium relative to the Sun) and a substellar C/O ratio. The inferred high metallicity and low C/O ratio may indicate significant accretion of solid materials during planet formation (for example, refs.               3,4               ,               ) or disequilibrium processes in the upper atmosphere (for example, refs.               5,6               ).},

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a key chemical species that is found in a wide range of planetary atmospheres. In the context of exoplanets, CO2 is an indicator of the metal enrichment (that is, elements heavier than helium, also called `metallicity')1--3, and thus the formation processes of the primary atmospheres of hot gas giants4--6. It is also one of the most promising species to detect in the secondary atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets7--9. Previous photometric measurements of transiting planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have given hints of the presence of CO2, but have not yielded definitive detections owing to the lack of unambiguous spectroscopic identification10--12. Here we present the detection of CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant exoplanet WASP-39b from transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with~JWST as part of the Early Release Science programme13,14. The data used in this study span 3.0--5.5\,micrometres in wavelength and show a prominent CO2 absorption feature at 4.3\,micrometres (26-sigma significance). The overall spectrum is well matched by one-dimensional, ten-times solar metallicity models that assume radiative--convective--thermochemical equilibrium and have moderate cloud opacity. These models predict that the atmosphere should have water, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide in addition to CO2, but little methane. Furthermore, we also tentatively detect a small absorption feature near 4.0\,micrometres that is not reproduced by these models.},

This method is devised in such a way that the resultant curve will pass through the given points and will appear smooth and natural. It is based on a piecewise function composed of a set of polynomials, each of degree three, at most, and applicable to successive intervals of the given points. In this method, the slope of the curve is determined at each given point locally, and each polynomial representing a portion of the curve between a pair of given points is determined by the coordinates of and the slopes at the points. Comparison indicates that the curve obtained by this new method is closer to a manually drawn curve than those drawn by other mathematical methods.},

  abstract = {Substellar companions at wide separation around stars hosting planets or brown dwarfs (BDs) yet close enough for their formation in the circumstellar disc are of special interest. In this letter we report the discovery of a wide (projected separation \${\textbackslash}sim\$16.0arcsec, or 2400 AU, and position angle 114.61\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$) companion of the GQ Lup A-B system, most likely gravitationally bound to it. A VLT/X-Shooter spectrum shows that this star, 2MASS J15491331-3539118, is a bonafide low-mass (\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.15 M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) young stellar object (YSO) with stellar and accretion/ejection properties typical of Lupus YSOs of similar mass, and with kinematics consistent with that of the GQ Lup A-B system. A possible scenario for the formation of the triple system is that GQ Lup A and 2MASS J15491331-3539118 formed by fragmentation of a turbulent core in the Lup I filament, while GQ Lup B, the BD companion of GQ Lup A at 0.7arcsec, formed in situ by the fragmentation of the circumprimary disc. The recent discoveries that stars form along cloud filaments would favour the scenario of turbulent fragmentation for the formation of GQ Lup A and 2MASS J15491331-3539118.},

  abstract = {The mass-accretion rate, {\.M}acc, is a crucial parameter for the study of the evolution of accretion disks around young low-mass stellar objects (YSOs) and for planet formation studies. The Taurus star forming region (SFR) is rich in pre-main sequence stars, most of them of the T Tauri class. A variety of methodologies have been used in the past to measure mass accretion in samples of YSOs in Taurus, but despite being a general benchmark for star formation studies, a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the Taurus T Tauri population, where the stellar and accretion properties are derived homogeneously and simultaneously, is still missing. As part of the GIARPS High-resolution Observations of T Tauri stars (GHOsT) project, here we present a pilot study of the stellar and accretion properties of seven YSOs in Taurus using the spectrograph GIARPS at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Contemporaneous low-resolution spectroscopic and photometric ancillary observations allow us to perform an accurate flux calibration of the high-resolution spectra. The simultaneity of the high-resolution, wide-band spectroscopic observations, from the optical to the near-infrared (NIR), the veiling measurements in such wide spectral range, and many well-calibrated emission line diagnostics allows us to derive the stellar and accretion properties of the seven YSOs in a homogeneous and self-consistent way. The procedures and methodologies presented here will be adopted in future works for the analysis of the complete GHOsT data set. We discuss the accretion properties of the seven YSOs in comparison with the 90\% complete sample of YSOs in the Lupus SFR and investigate possibilities for the origin of the continuum excess emission in the NIR. Based on observations made with the GIARPS instrument at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo under program A36TAC\_22 (PI: Antoniucci).},

  abstract = {We present VLT/X-shooter observations of a sample of 36 accreting low-mass stellar and substellar objects (YSOs) in the Lupus star-forming region, spanning a range in mass from {\textasciitilde}0.03 to {\textasciitilde}1.2 M{$\odot$}, but mostly with 0.1 M{$\odot\star<$} 0.5 M{$\odot$}. Our aim is twofold: firstly, to analyse the relationship between excess-continuum and line emission accretion diagnostics, and, secondly, to investigate the accretion properties in terms of the physical properties of the central object. The accretion luminosity (Lacc), and in turn the accretion rate ({\.M}acc), was derived by modelling the excess emission from the UV to the near-infrared as the continuum emission of a slab of hydrogen. We computed the flux and luminosity (Lline) of many emission lines of H , He , and Ca ii, observed simultaneously in the range from {\textasciitilde}330 nm to 2500 nm. The luminosity of all the lines is well correlated with Lacc. We provide empirical relationships between Lacc and the luminosity of 39 emission lines, which have a lower dispersion than relationships previously reported in the literature. Our measurements extend the Pa{$\beta$} and Br{$\gamma$} relationships to Lacc values about two orders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous studies. We confirm that different methodologies of measuring Lacc and {\.M}acc yield significantly different results: H{$\alpha$} line profile modelling may underestimate {\.M}acc by 0.6 to 0.8 dex with respect to {\.M}acc derived from continuum-excess measures. These differences may explain the probably spurious bi-modal relationships between {\.M}acc and other YSOs properties reported in the literature. We derived {\.M}acc in the range 2 {\texttimes} 10-12-4 {\texttimes} 10-8 M{$\odot$} yr-1 and conclude that {\.M}acc {$\propto$} M{$\star$}1.8({\textpm}0.2), with a dispersion lower by a factor of about 2 than in previous studies. A number of properties indicate that the physical conditions of the accreting gas are similar over more than 5 orders of magnitude in {\.M}acc, confirming previous suggestions that the geometry of the accretion flow controls the rate at which the disc material accretes onto the central star.

  abstract = {The mass accretion rate, {\.M}acc, is a key quantity for the understanding of the physical processes governing the evolution of accretion discs around young low-mass (M{$\star$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 2.0 M{$\odot$}) stars and substellar objects (YSOs). We present here the results of a study of the stellar and accretion properties of the (almost) complete sample of class II and transitional YSOs in the Lupus I, II, III and IV clouds, based on spectroscopic data acquired with the VLT/X-shooter spectrograph. Our study combines the dataset from our previous work with new observations of 55 additional objects. We have investigated 92 YSO candidates in total, 11 of which have been definitely identified with giant stars unrelated to Lupus. The stellar and accretion properties of the 81 bona fide YSOs, which represent more than 90\% of the whole class II and transition disc YSO population in the aforementioned Lupus clouds, have been homogeneously and self-consistently derived, allowing for an unbiased study of accretion and its relationship with stellar parameters. The accretion luminosity, Lacc, increases with the stellar luminosity, L{$\star$}, with an overall slope of 1.6, similar but with a smaller scatter than in previous studies. There is a significant lack of strong accretors below L{$\star$} {$\approx$} 0.1 L{$\odot$}, where Lacc is always lower than 0.01 L{$\star$}. We argue that the Lacc - L{$\star$} slope is not due to observational biases, but is a true property of the Lupus YSOs. The log {\.M}acc - log M{$\star$} correlation shows a statistically significant evidence of a break, with a steeper relation for M{$\star$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.2 M{$\odot$} and a flatter slope for higher masses. The bimodality of the {\.M}acc - M{$\star$} relation is confirmed with four different evolutionary models used to derive the stellar mass. The bimodal behaviour of the observed relationship supports the importance of modelling self-gravity in the early evolution of the more massive discs, but other processes, such as photo-evaporation and planet formation during the YSO's lifetime, may also lead to disc dispersal on different timescales depending on the stellar mass. The sample studied here more than doubles the number of YSOs with homogeneously and simultaneously determined Lacc and luminosity, Lline, of many permitted emission lines. Hence, we also refined the empirical relationships between Lacc and Lline on a more solid statistical basis.

  abstract = {Measuring the abundances of carbon and oxygen in exoplanet atmospheres is considered a crucial avenue for unlocking the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems1,2. Access to the chemical inventory of an exoplanet requires high-precision observations, often inferred from individual molecular detections with low-resolution space-based3--5 and high-resolution ground-based6--8 facilities. Here we report the medium-resolution (R\,{$\approx$}\,600) transmission spectrum of an exoplanet atmosphere between 3 and 5\,{$\mu$}m covering several absorption features for the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b (ref.\,9), obtained with the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) G395H grating of JWST. Our observations achieve 1.46\,times photon precision, providing an average transit depth uncertainty of 221\,ppm per spectroscopic bin, and present minimal impacts from systematic effects. We detect significant absorption from CO2 (28.5{$\sigma$}) and H2O (21.5{$\sigma$}), and identify SO2 as the source of absorption at 4.1\,{$\mu$}m (4.8{$\sigma$}). Best-fit atmospheric models range between 3 and 10\,times solar metallicity, with sub-solar to solar C/O ratios. These results, including the detection of SO2, underscore the importance of characterizing the chemistry in exoplanet atmospheres and showcase NIRSpec G395H as an excellent mode for time-series observations over this critical wavelength range10.},

  abstract = {The initial isotopic composition of water in the Solar System is of paramount importance to understanding the origin of water on planetary bodies but remains unknown, despite numerous studies1-5. Here we use the isotopic composition of hydrogen in calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs) from primitive meteorites, the oldest Solar System rocks, to establish the hydrogen isotopic composition of water at the onset of Solar System formation. We report the hydrogen isotopic composition of nominally anhydrous minerals from CAI fragments trapped in a once-melted host CAI. Primary minerals have extremely low D/H ratios, with {$\delta$}D values down to -850‰, recording the trapping of nebular hydrogen. Minerals rich in oxidised iron formed before the capture of the fragments record the existence of a nebular gas reservoir with an oxygen fugacity substantially above the solar value and a D/H ratio within 20\% of that of the Earth's oceans. Hydrogen isotopes also correlate with oxygen and nitrogen isotopes, indicating that planetary reservoirs of volatile elements formed within the first 2 {\texttimes} 105 years of the Solar System, during the main CAI formation epoch. We propose that the isotopic composition of inner Solar System water was established during the collapse of the protosolar cloud core owing to a massive admixture of interstellar water.},

  abstract = {All chondrites accreted {$\sim$}3.5wt.\%C in their matrices, the bulk of which was in a macromolecular solvent and acid insoluble organic material (IOM). Similar material to IOM is found in interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) and comets. The IOM accounts for almost all of the C and N in chondrites, and a significant fraction of the H. Chondrites and, to a lesser extent, comets were probably the major sources of volatiles for the Earth and the other terrestrial planets. Hence, IOM was both the major source of Earth's volatiles and a potential source of complex prebiotic molecules. Large enrichments in D and 15N, relative to the bulk solar isotopic compositions, suggest that IOM or its precursors formed in very cold, radiation-rich environments. Whether these environments were in the interstellar medium (ISM) or the outer Solar System is unresolved. Nevertheless, the elemental and isotopic compositions and functional group chemistry of IOM provide important clues to the origin(s) of organic matter in protoplanetary disks. IOM is modified relatively easily by thermal and aqueous processes, so that it can also be used to constrain the conditions in the solar nebula prior to chondrite accretion and the conditions in the chondrite parent bodies after accretion. Here we review what is known about the abundances, compositions and physical nature of IOM in the most primitive chondrites. We also discuss how the IOM has been modified by thermal metamorphism and aqueous alteration in the chondrite parent bodies, and how these changes may be used both as petrologic indicators of the intensity of parent body processing and as tools for classification. Finally, we critically assess the various proposed mechanisms for the formation of IOM in the ISM or Solar System.},

We show that taking these effects into account can lead to much more rapid formation of giant planets, making it compatible with the typical disc lifetimes inferred from observations of young circumstellar discs. This speed up is due to the fact that migration prevents the severe depletion of the feeding zone as observed in in situ calculations. Hence, the growing planet is never isolated and it can reach cross-over mass on a much shorter timescale. To illustrate the range of planets that can form in our model, we describe a set of simulations in which we have varied some of the initial parameters and compare the final masses and semi-major axes with those inferred from observed extra-solar planets.},

High-resolution synthetic spectra are obtained using an opacity sampling method.

The model spectra give close agreement with observations of M{\textasciitilde}dwarfs across a wide spectral range from the blue to the near-IR, with one notable exception: the fit to the water bands. We discuss several practical applications of our model grid, e.g., broadband colors derived from the synthetic spectra. In light of current efforts to identify genuine brown dwarfs, we also show how low-resolution spectra of cool dwarfs vary with surface gravity, and how the high-resolution line profile of the Li{\textasciitilde}I resonance doublet depends on the Li abundance.},

In parallel, low-mass planets are being sought around red dwarfs, which offer more favourable conditions, for both radial velocity detection and transit studies, than solar-type stars. In this paper, the authors of a model atmosphere code that has allowed the detection of water vapour in the atmosphere of hot Jupiters review recent advances in modelling the stellar to substellar transition. The revised solar oxygen abundances and cloud model allow the photometric and spectroscopic properties of this transition to be reproduced for the first time. Also presented are highlight results of a model atmosphere grid for stars, brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets.},

We present a comprehensive study of Na-H2 collisional profiles at temperatures from 500 to 3000 K, the temperatures prevailing in the atmosphere of brown dwarfs and Jupiter-mass planets. The relevant H2 perturber densities reach several 1019 cm-3 in hot (Teff {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1500 K) Jupiter-mass planets and can exceed 1020 cm-3 for more massive or cooler objects. Accurate pressure-broadened profiles that are valid at high densities of H2 should be incorporated into spectral models.

The spectrum of one of our objects indicates a spectral type of {\textasciitilde}L1, making it one of the latest spectral type young brown dwarfs identified to date. Comparing spectra of young brown dwarfs, field dwarfs, and giant stars, we define a 1.49-1.56 {$\mu$}m H2O index capable of determining spectral type to +/-1 subtype, independent of gravity. We have also defined an index based on the 1.14 {$\mu$}m sodium feature that is sensitive to gravity, but only weakly dependent on spectral type. Our 1.14 {$\mu$}m Na index can be used to distinguish young cluster members ({$\tau<$}{\textasciitilde}5 Myr) from young field dwarfs, both of which may have the triangular H-band continuum shape that persists for at least tens of Myr. Using Teff values determined from the spectral types of our objects along with luminosities derived from near and mid-infrared photometry, we place our objects on the H-R diagram and overlay evolutionary models to estimate the masses and ages of our young sources. Three of our sources have inferred ages ({$\tau$}{\textasciitilde}=10-30 Myr) that are significantly older than the median stellar age of their parent clouds (1-3 Myr). For these three objects, we derive masses {\textasciitilde}3 times greater than expected for 1-3 Myr old brown dwarfs with the bolometric luminosities of our sources. The large discrepancies in the inferred masses and ages determined using two separate, yet reasonable, methods emphasize the need for caution when deriving or exploiting brown dwarf mass and age estimates.},

First, we establish a method for spectral typing M5-L7 dwarfs at near-IR wavelengths that is independent of gravity. We find that both visual and index-based classification in the near-IR provides consistent spectral types with optical spectral types, though with a small systematic offset in the case of visual classification at J and K band. Second, we examine features in the spectra of {\textasciitilde}10 Myr ultracool dwarfs to define a set of gravity-sensitive indices based on FeH, VO, K I, Na I, and H-band continuum shape. We then create an index-based method for classifying the gravities of M6-L5 dwarfs that provides consistent results with gravity classifications from optical spectroscopy. Our index-based classification can distinguish between young and dusty objects. Guided by the resulting classifications, we propose a set of low-gravity spectral standards for the near-IR. Finally, we estimate the ages corresponding to our gravity classifications.},

The goal of this paper is to describe the validation results in terms of completeness, accuracy and precision of the various Gaia DR2 data. The validation processes include a systematic analysis of the Catalogue content to detect anomalies, either individual errors or statistical properties, using statistical analysis, and comparisons to external data or to models. Although the astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic data are of unprecedented quality and quantity, it is shown that the data cannot be used without a dedicated attention to the limitations described here, in the Catalogue documentation and in accompanying papers.

  abstract = {We present a study on the coupling of haze and clouds in the atmosphere of WASP-39b. We developed a cloud microphysics model simulating the formation of Na2S and MgSiO3 condensates over photochemical hazes in gas giant atmospheres. We apply this model to WASP-39b, recently observed with the JWST to study how these heterogeneous components may affect the transit spectrum. We simulate both morning and evening terminators independently and average their transit spectra. While MgSiO3 formation has negligible impact on the spectrum, Na2S condensates produce grey opacities in the water band, in agreement with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST observations. Moreover, the formation of Na2S on the morning side depletes the atmosphere of its sodium content, decreasing the strength of the Na line. Combining morning and evening profiles results in a good fit of the Na observations. These nominal results assume a small Na2S/haze contact angle (5.7{$^\circ$}). Using a larger value (61{$^\circ$}) reduces the cloud density and opacity, but the effect on the Na profile and spectral line remains identical. In addition, the presence of haze in the upper atmosphere reproduces the ultraviolet (UV)-visible slope observed in the HST and Very Large Telescope data and contributes to the opacity between the water bands at wavelengths below 2 {$\mu$}m. The averaged spectra are rather insensitive to the variation of eddy diffusion and haze mass flux tested in this study, though the UV-visible slope, probing the haze layer above the clouds, is affected. Finally, our disequilibrium chemistry model, including photochemistry, reproduces the SO2 and CO2 absorption features observed.},

We find that the MRS geometric calibration has a distortion solution accuracy relative to the commanded position of 8 mas at 5 {\textmu}m and 23 mas at 28 {\textmu}m. The wavelength calibration is accurate to within 9 km s-1 at 5 {\textmu}m and 27 km s-1 at 28 {\textmu}m. The uncertainty in the absolute spectro-photometric calibration accuracy was estimated at 5.6 {\textpm} 0.7\%. The MIRI calibration pipeline is able to suppress the amplitude of spectral fringes to below 1.5\% for both extended and point sources across the entire wavelength range. The MRS point spread function (PSF) is 60\% broader than the diffraction limit along its long axis at 5 {\textmu}m and is 15\% broader at 28 {\textmu}m. Conclusions. The MRS flight performance is found to be better than prelaunch expectations. The MRS is one of the most subscribed observing modes of JWST and is yielding many high-profile publications. It is currently humanity's most powerful instrument for measuring the mid-infrared spectra of celestial sources and is expected to continue as such for many years to come.},

Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

New complete and comprehensive 3D spectral line formation calculations taking into account of departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) are presented for Na, Mg, K, Ca, and Fe using comprehensive model atoms with reliable radiative and collisional data. Our newly derived abundances for C, N, and O are based on a 3D non-LTE analysis of permitted and forbidden atomic lines as well as 3D LTE calculations for a total of 879 molecular transitions of CH, C2, CO, NH, CN, and OH. Previous 3D-based calculations for another 50 elements are re-evaluated based on updated atomic data, a stringent selection of lines, improved consideration of blends, and new non-LTE calculations available in the literature. For elements where spectroscopic determinations of the quiet Sun are not possible, the recommended solar abundances are revisited based on complementary methods, including helioseismology (He), solar wind data from the Genesis sample return mission (noble gases), sunspot observations (four elements), and measurements of the most primitive meteorites (15 elements). Results. Our new improved analysis confirms the relatively low solar abundances of C, N, and O obtained in our previous 3D-based studies: log C = 8.46 {\textpm} 0.04, log N = 7.83 {\textpm} 0.07, and log O = 8.69 {\textpm} 0.04. Excellent agreement between all available atomic and molecular indicators is achieved for C and O, but for N the atomic lines imply a lower abundance than for the molecular transitions for unknown reasons. The revised solar abundances for the other elements also typically agree well with our previously recommended values, with only Li, F, Ne, Mg, Cl, Kr, Rb, Rh, Ba, W, Ir, and Pb differing by more than 0.05 dex. The here-advocated present-day photospheric metal mass fraction is only slightly higher than our previous value, mainly due to the revised Ne abundance from Genesis solar wind measurements: Xsurface = 0.7438 {\textpm} 0.0054, Ysurface = 0.2423 {\textpm} 0.0054, Zsurface = 0.0139 {\textpm} 0.0006, and Zsurface/Xsurface = 0.0187 {\textpm} 0.0009. Overall, the solar abundances agree well with those of CI chondritic meteorites, but we identify a correlation with condensation temperature such that moderately volatile elements are enhanced by {$\approx$}0.04 dex in the CI chondrites and refractory elements possibly depleted by {$\approx$}0.02 dex, conflicting with conventional wisdom of the past half-century. Instead, the solar chemical composition more closely resembles that of the fine-grained matrix of CM chondrites with the expected exception of the highly volatile elements. Conclusions. Updated present-day solar photospheric and proto-solar abundances are presented for 83 elements, including for all long-lived isotopes. The so-called solar modelling problem -- a persistent discrepancy between helioseismology and solar interior models constructed with a low solar metallicity similar to that advocated here -- remains intact with our revised solar abundances, suggesting shortcomings with the computed opacities and/or treatment of mixing below the convection zone in existing standard solar models. The uncovered trend between the solar and CI chondritic abundances with condensation temperature is not yet understood but is likely imprinted by planet formation, especially since a similar trend of opposite sign is observed between the Sun and solar twins.},

We find that previous, mainly 1D, analyses were systematically biased toward lower isotopic ratios (e.g., R23 {$\equiv$} 12C/13C), suggesting an isotopically ``heavy'' Sun contrary to accepted fractionation processes that were thought to have operated in the primitive solar nebula. The new 3D ratios for 13C and 18O are R23 = 91.4 {\textpm} 1.3 (R{$\oplus$} = 89.2) and R68 = 511 {\textpm} 10 (R{$\oplus$} = 499), where the uncertainties are 1{$\sigma$} and ``optimistic.'' We also obtained R67 = 2738 {\textpm} 118 (R{$\oplus$} = 2632), but we caution that the observed 12C17O features are extremely weak. The new solar ratios for the oxygen isotopes fall between the terrestrial values and those reported by Genesis (R68 = 530, R67 = 2798), although including both within 2{$\sigma$} error flags, and go in the direction favoring recent theories for the oxygen isotope composition of Ca--Al inclusions in primitive meteorites. While not a major focus of this work, we derive an oxygen abundance, {$\epsilon$}O {$\sim$} 603 {\textpm} 9 ppm (relative to hydrogen; log {$\epsilon$} {$\sim$} 8.78 on the H = 12 scale). The fact that the Sun is likely lighter than the Earth, isotopically speaking, removes the necessity of invoking exotic fractionation processes during the early construction of the inner solar system.},

In CW Tau, the total and polarized emission are both smooth and symmetric, with polarization angles almost parallel to the minor axis of the projected disk. In contrast, DG Tau displays a structured polarized emission, with an elongated brighter region in the disk's near side and a belt-like feature beyond about 0 3 from the source. At the same time, the total intensity is spatially smooth, with no features. The polarization pattern, almost parallel to the minor axis in the inner region, becomes azimuthal in the outer belt, possibly because of a drop in optical depth. The polarization fraction has average values of 1.2\% in CW Tau and 0.4\% in DG Tau. Our results are consistent with polarization from self-scattering of the dust thermal emission. In this hypothesis, the maximum size of the grains contributing to polarization is in the range 100--150 {$\mu$}m for CW Tau and 50--70 {$\mu$}m for DG Tau. The polarization maps combined with dust opacity estimates indicate that these grains are distributed in a geometrically thin layer in CW Tau, representing a settling in the disk midplane. Meanwhile, such settling is not yet apparent for DG Tau. These results advocate polarization studies as a fundamental complement to total emission observations, in investigations of the structure and the evolution of protoplanetary disks.},

These features need to be removed in order to reveal the true spectrum of the object being observed. The traditional technique for doing this is to observe a standard star with a relatively featureless spectrum (a smooth spectrum standard) and divide the observed spectrum of the object by that of the standard. This technique has a number of practical difficulties but is also fundamentally flawed. Even with a perfectly smooth spectrum standard observed at an identical air mass to the object, this technique does not, in general, reproduce the spectrum of the object that would have been observed in the absence of the Earth's atmosphere. The problem arises because of the presence of high-resolution structure in the molecular absorption features, generally on a finer scale than the resolution of the observed spectrum. The transmission of the Earth's atmosphere for any spectral bin then depends on the unresolved spectral structure of the light being transmitted and cannot be represented by a unique value derived from the standard star, as the traditional technique assumes. We use high-resolution line-by-line radiative transfer models to quantify these effects for two cases: observations of a solar-type star, and observations of the planet Mars. For a solar-type star, application of the traditional technique causes errors of a few percent in the vicinity of strong atmospheric absorption features. The case of the planet Mars is an extreme case, since Mars has the same CO2 absorption features as the Earth's atmosphere. Our simulations show that applying the traditional astronomical technique to ground-based spectra of the planet Mars leads to systematic errors of up to {$\sim$}50\% in the vicinity of the strong CO2 absorption features. High-quality IR spectroscopy with ground-based telescopes requires an improved technique to handle the absorption in the Earth's atmosphere. We outline a possible approach based on the use of radiative transfer models for the Earth's atmosphere. We note that in general it is not possible to correct observed spectra for atmospheric absorption. However, a forward-modeling approach can be used in which a model spectrum for the object is generated, atmospheric transmission effects added, and the result compared with the observed spectrum.

It is confirmed to be comoving with its 13 {\textpm} 2 Myr F5 host using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys astrometry over a time baseline of 8.3 yr. DUSTY and COND evolutionary models predict that the companion's luminosity corresponds to a mass of 11 {\textpm} 2 MJup, making it one of the most widely separated planetary-mass companions known. We classify its Magellan/Folded-Port InfraRed Echellette J/H/K spectrum as L2.5 {\textpm} 1; the triangular H-band morphology suggests an intermediate surface gravity. HD 106906 A, a pre-main-sequence Lower Centaurus Crux member, was initially targeted because it hosts a massive debris disk detected via infrared excess emission in unresolved Spitzer imaging and spectroscopy. The disk emission is best fit by a single component at 95 K, corresponding to an inner edge of 15--20 AU and an outer edge of up to 120 AU. If the companion is on an eccentric (e {$>$} 0.65) orbit, it could be interacting with the outer edge of the disk. Close-in, planet-like formation followed by scattering to the current location would likely disrupt the disk and is disfavored. Furthermore, we find no additional companions, though we could detect similar-mass objects at projected separations {$>$}35 AU. In situ formation in a binary-star-like process is more probable, although the companion-to-primary mass ratio, at {$<$}1\%, is unusually small.},

The attainable precision of HAT has been significantly improved by a technique in which the telescope is made to execute small pointing steps during each exposure so as to broaden the effective point-spread function (PSF) of the system to a value more compatible with the pixel size of our CCD detector. Experiments during a preliminary survey (spring 2003) of two star fields with the HAT-5 instrument allowed us to optimize the HAT photometric precision using this method of PSF broadening; in this way we have been able to achieve a precision as good as 2 mmag on brighter stars.

  abstract = {Tension remains between the observed and modeled properties of substellar objects, but objects in binary orbits, with known dynamical masses can provide a way forward. HD 72946 B is a recently imaged brown dwarf companion to the nearby, solar type star. We achieve \${\textbackslash}sim100{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mathrm\{as\}\$ relative astrometry of HD 72946 B in the K-band using VLTI/GRAVITY, unprecedented for a benchmark brown dwarf. We fit an ensemble of measurements of the orbit using orbitize! and derive a strong dynamical mass constraint \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_B\}=69.5{\textbackslash}pm0.5{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{Jup\}\}\$ assuming a strong prior on the host star mass \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_A\}=0.97{\textbackslash}pm0.01{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ from an updated stellar analysis. We fit the spectrum of the companion to a grid of self-consistent BT-Settl-CIFIST model atmospheres, and perform atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS. A dynamical mass prior only marginally influences the sampled distribution on effective temperature, but has a large influence on the surface gravity and radius, as expected. The dynamical mass alone does not strongly influence retrieved pressure-temperature or cloud parameters within our current retrieval setup. Independent of cloud prescription and prior assumptions, we find agreement within \${\textbackslash}pm2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$ between the C/O ratio of the host (\$0.52{\textbackslash}pm0.05)\$ and brown dwarf (\$0.43\$ to \$0.63\$), as expected from a molecular cloud collapse formation scenario, but our retrieved metallicities are implausibly high (\$0.6-0.8\$) in light of an excellent agreement of the data with the solar abundance model grid. Future work on our retrieval framework will seek to resolve this tension. Additional study of low surface-gravity objects is necessary to assess the influence of a dynamical mass prior on atmospheric analysis.},

  abstract = {Young, low-mass Brown Dwarfs orbiting early-type stars, with low mass ratios (\$q{\textbackslash}lesssim0.01\$), appear intrinsically rare and present a formation dilemma: could a handful of these objects be the highest mass outcomes of ``planetary" formation channels (bottom up within a protoplanetary disk), or are they more representative of the lowest mass ``failed binaries" (formed via disk fragmentation, or core fragmentation)? Additionally, their orbits can yield model-independent dynamical masses, and when paired with wide wavelength coverage and accurate system age estimates, can constrain evolutionary models in a regime where the models have a wide dispersion depending on initial conditions. We present new interferometric observations of the \$16{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Myr\}\$ substellar companion HD{\textasciitilde}136164{\textasciitilde}Ab (HIP{\textasciitilde}75056{\textasciitilde}Ab) with VLTI/GRAVITY and an updated orbit fit including proper motion measurements from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations. We estimate a dynamical mass of \$35{\textbackslash}pm10{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_J\}\$ (\$q{\textbackslash}sim0.02\$), making HD{\textasciitilde}136164{\textasciitilde}Ab the youngest substellar companion with a dynamical mass estimate. The new mass and newly constrained orbital eccentricity (\$e=0.44{\textbackslash}pm0.03\$) and separation (\$22.5{\textbackslash}pm1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{au\}\$) could indicate that the companion formed via the low-mass tail of the Initial Mass Function. Our atmospheric fit to the {\textbackslash}texttt\{SPHINX\} M-dwarf model grid suggests a sub-solar C/O ratio of \$0.45\$, and \$3{\textbackslash}times\$ solar metallicity, which could indicate formation in the circumstellar disk via disk fragmentation. Either way, the revised mass estimate likely excludes ``bottom-up" formation via core accretion in the circumstellar disk. HD{\textasciitilde}136164{\textasciitilde}Ab joins a select group of young substellar objects with dynamical mass estimates; epoch astrometry from future {\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\} data releases will constrain the dynamical mass of this crucial object further.},

We analyse current theoretical uncertainties due to molecular line lists, convection and initial conditions. Simple tests on initial conditions show the high uncertainties of models at ages 1 Myr. We find a significant sensitivity of atmosphere profiles to the treatment of convection at low gravity and K, whereas it vanishes as gravity increases. This effect adds another source of uncertainty on evolutionary tracks at very early phases. We show that at low surface gravity () the common picture of vertical Hayashi lines with constant \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} is oversimplified. The effect of a variation of initial deuterium abundance is studied. We compare our models with evolutionary tracks available in the literature and discuss the main differences. We finally analyse to what extent current observations of young systems provide a good test for pre-Main Sequence tracks.}}},

  abstract = {Using the integral field spectrograph OSIRIS, on the Keck II telescope, broad near-infrared H- and K-band spectra of the young exoplanet HR8799b have been obtained. In addition, six new narrowband photometric measurements have been taken across the H and K bands. These data are combined with previously published photometry for an analysis of the planet's atmospheric properties. Thick photospheric dust cloud opacity is invoked to explain the planet's red near-IR colors and relatively smooth near-IR spectrum. Strong water absorption is detected, indicating a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. Only weak CH4 absorption is detected at K band, indicating efficient vertical mixing and a disequilibrium CO/CH4 ratio at photospheric depths. The H-band spectrum has a distinct triangular shape consistent with low surface gravity. New giant planet atmosphere models are compared to these data with best-fitting bulk parameters, Teff = 1100 K {\textpm}100 and log (g) = 3.5 {\textpm} 0.5 (for solar composition). Given the observed luminosity (log Lobs/L{$\Sun$} {$\sim$} - 5.1), these values correspond to a radius of 0.75 RJup+0.17- 0.12 and a mass of {$\sim$}0.72 MJup+2.6 - 0.6---strikingly inconsistent with interior/evolution models. Enhanced metallicity (up to {$\sim$}10{\texttimes} that of the Sun) along with thick clouds and non-equilibrium chemistry are likely required to reproduce the complete ensemble of spectroscopic and photometric data and the low effective temperatures ({$<$}1000 K) required by the evolution models.},

  abstract = {Brown dwarfs serve as ideal laboratories for studying the atmospheres of giant exoplanets on wide orbits, as the governing physical and chemical processes within them are nearly identical1,2. Understanding the formation of gas-giant planets is challenging, often involving the endeavour to link atmospheric abundance ratios, such as the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio, to formation scenarios3. However, the complexity of planet formation requires further tracers, as the unambiguous interpretation of the measured C/O ratio is fraught with complexity4. Isotope ratios, such as deuterium to hydrogen and 14N/15N, offer a promising avenue to gain further insight into this formation process, mirroring their use within the Solar System5--7. For exoplanets, only a handful of constraints on 12C/13C exist, pointing to the accretion of 13C-rich ice from beyond the CO iceline of the disks8,9. Here we report on the mid-infrared detection of the 14NH3 and 15NH3 isotopologues in the atmosphere of a cool brown dwarf with an effective temperature of 380\,K in a spectrum taken with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of JWST. As expected, our results reveal a 14N/15N value consistent with star-like formation by gravitational collapse, demonstrating that this ratio can be accurately constrained. Because young stars and their planets should be more strongly enriched in the 15N isotope10, we expect that 15NH3 will be detectable in several cold, wide-separation exoplanets.},

All lines are seen in absorption. Rotation diagrams indicate that the gas is optically thick and lines are observed to saturate at 40\% and 15\% relative to the continuum for AFGL 2136 and AFGL 2591, respectively. We applied two curve of growth analyses to derive the physical conditions, one assuming a foreground origin and one a circumstellar disk origin. We find temperatures of 400--600 K. A foreground origin would require the presence of externally heated clumps that are smaller than the continuum source. The disk analysis is based on stellar atmosphere theory, which takes into consideration the temperature gradient in the disk. We discuss the challenges with each model, taking into consideration the properties of other species detected in the spectral survey, and conclude that further modeling efforts are required to establish whether the absorption has a disk or foreground origin. The main challenge to the foreground model is that molecules are expected to be observed in emission. The main challenges to the disk model are the midplane heating mechanism and the presence of narrow absorption lines shifted from the systemic velocity.},

  abstract = {Results of a comprehensive, new, ground-based mid-infrared imaging survey of the young stellar population of the {$\rho$} Ophiuchi cloud are presented. Data were acquired at the Palomar 5 m and at the Keck 10 m telescopes with the MIRLIN and LWS instruments, at 0.{${''}$}5 and 0.{${''}$}25 resolutions, respectively. Of 172 survey objects, 85 were detected. Among the 22 multiple systems observed, 15 were resolved and their individual component fluxes determined. A plot of the frequency distribution of the detected objects with SED spectral slope shows that YSOs spend 4 {\texttimes} 105 yr in the flat-spectrum phase, clearing out their remnant infall envelopes. Mid-infrared variability is found among a significant fraction of the surveyed objects and is found to occur for all SED classes with optically thick disks. Large-amplitude near-infrared variability, also found for all SED classes with optically thick disks, seems to occur with somewhat higher frequency at the earlier evolutionary stages. Although a general trend of mid-infrared excess and near-infrared veiling exists progressing through SED classes, with Class I objects generally exhibiting rK {$\geq$} 1, flat-spectrum objects with rK {$\geq$} 0.58, and Class III objects with rK = 0, Class II objects exhibit the widest range of rK values, ranging from 0 {$\leq$} rK {$\leq$} 4.5. However, the highly variable value of veiling that a single source can exhibit in any of the SED classes in which active disk accretion can take place is striking and is direct observational evidence for highly time-variable accretion activity in disks. Finally, by comparing mid-infrared versus near-infrared excesses in a subsample with well-determined effective temperatures and extinction values, disk-clearing mechanisms are explored. The results are consistent with disk clearing proceeding from the inside out.},

The brown dwarfs form via the fragmentation of dense molecular gas in unstable multiple systems and are ejected from the dense gas before they have been able to accrete to stellar masses. Thus, they can be viewed as `failed stars'. Approximately three-quarters of the brown dwarfs form in gravitationally unstable circumstellar discs while the remainder form in collapsing filaments of molecular gas. These formation mechanisms are very efficient, producing roughly the same number of brown dwarfs as stars, in agreement with recent observations. However, because close dynamical interactions are involved in their formation, we find a very low frequency of binary brown dwarf systems (\& 5 per cent) and that those binary brown dwarf systems that do exist must be close, \& 10 au. Similarly, we find that young brown dwarfs with large circumstellar discs (radii * 10 au) are rare ({$<$} 5 per cent).},

In this paper, we present the results of a K-band integral field unit spectroscopic study of Br{$\gamma$} emission in eight young protostars: CW Tau, DG Tau, Haro 6-10, HL Tau, HV Tau C, RW Aur, T Tau, and XZ Tau. We spatially resolve Br{$\gamma$} emission structures in half of these young stars and find that most of the extended emission is consistent with the location and velocities of the known Herbig-Haro flows associated with these systems. At some velocities through the Br{$\gamma$} line profile, the spatially extended emission comprises 20\% or more of the integrated flux in that spectral channel. However, the total spatially extended Br{$\gamma$} is typically less than {\textasciitilde}10\% of the flux integrated over the full emission profile. For DG Tau and Haro 6-10 S, we estimate the mass outflow rate using simple assumptions about the hydrogen emission region and compare this to the derived mass accretion rate. We detect extended Br{$\gamma$} in the vicinity of the more obscured targets in our sample and conclude that spatially extended Br{$\gamma$} emission may exist toward other stars, but unattenuated photospheric flux probably limits its detectability.

At this stage we are uncomfortable assigning a final, unambiguous age to the Argus association as our membership list for the association appears to suffer from a high level of contamination, and therefore it remains unclear whether these stars represent a single population of coeval stars. Our isochronal ages for both the BPMG and Tuc--Hor are consistent with recent lithium depletion boundary (LDB) ages, which unlike isochronal ages, are relatively insensitive to the choice of low-mass evolutionary models. This consistency between the isochronal and LDB ages instils confidence that our self-consistent, absolute age scale for young, nearby moving groups is robust, and hence we suggest that these ages be adopted for future studies of these groups.

Transit observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b rule out cloud-free H2-dominated scenarios, but are not able to determine whether the lack of deep spectral features is due to high-altitude clouds or the presence of a high mean molecular mass atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate that one can unambiguously distinguish between cloudy mini-Neptunes and volatile-dominated worlds based on wing steepness and relative depths of absorption features in moderate-resolution near-infrared transmission spectra (R {$\sim$} 100). In a numerical retrieval study, we show for GJ 1214b that an unambiguous distinction between a cloudy H2-dominated atmosphere and cloud-free H2O atmosphere will be possible if the uncertainties in the spectral transit depth measurements can be reduced by a factor of {$\sim$}3 compared to the published Hubble Space Telescope Wide-Field Camera 3 and Very Large Telescope transit observations by Berta et al. and Bean et al. We argue that the required precision for the distinction may be achievable with currently available instrumentation by stacking 10--15 repeated transit observations. We provide a scaling law that scales our quantitative results to other transiting super-Earths and Neptunes such as HD 97658b, 55 Cnc e, GJ 3470b and GJ 436b. The analysis in this work is performed using an improved version of our Bayesian atmospheric retrieval framework. The new framework not only constrains the gas composition and cloud/haze parameters, but also determines our confidence in having detected molecules and cloud/haze species through Bayesian model comparison. Using the Bayesian tool, we demonstrate quantitatively that the subtle transit depth variation in the Berta et al. data is not sufficient to claim the detection of water absorption.},

  abstract = {Based on spectra from F and G dwarf stars, we present elemental abundance trends in the Galactic thin and thick disks in the metallicity regime -0.8 [Fe/H] +0.4. Our findings can be summarized as follows. 1) Both the thin and the thick disks show smooth and distinct abundance trends that, at sub-solar metallicities, are clearly separated. 2) For the {$\alpha$}-elements the thick disk shows signatures of chemical enrichment from SNe type Ia. 3) The age of the thick disk sample is in the mean older than the thin disk sample. 4) Kinematically, there exist thick disk stars with super-solar metallicities. Based on these findings, together with other constraints from the literature, we discuss different formation scenarios for the thick disk. We suggest that the currently most likely formation scenario is a violent merger event or a close encounter with a companion galaxy. Based on kinematics the stellar sample was selected to contain stars with high probabilities of belonging either to the thin or to the thick Galactic disk. The total number of stars are 66 of which 21 belong to the thick disk and 45 to the thin disk. The analysis is based on high-resolution spectra with high signal-to-noise (R {$\sim$} 48 000 and S /N 150, respectively) recorded with the FEROS spectrograph on La Silla, Chile. Abundances have been determined for four {$\alpha$}-elements (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), for four even-nuclei iron peak elements (Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn), and for the light elements Na and Al, from equivalent width measurements of {$\sim$}30 000 spectral lines. An extensive investigation of the atomic parameters, log g f -values in particular, have been performed in order to achieve abundances that are trustworthy. Noteworthy is that we find for Ti good agreement between the abundances from Ti  and Ti . Our solar Ti abundances are in concordance with the standard meteoritic Ti abundance.},

  abstract = {Aims: The aim of this paper is to explore and map the age and abundance structure of the stars in the nearby Galactic disk. Methods: We have conducted a high-resolution spectroscopic study of 714 F and G dwarf and subgiant stars in the Solar neighbourhood. The star sample has been kinematically selected to trace the Galactic thin and thick disks to their extremes, the metal-rich stellar halo, sub-structures in velocity space such as the Hercules stream and the Arcturus moving group, as well as stars that cannot (kinematically) be associated with either the thin disk or the thick disk. The determination of stellar parameters and elemental abundances is based on a standard analysis using equivalent widths and one-dimensional, plane-parallel model atmospheres calculated under the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE). The spectra have high resolution (R = 40 000-110 000) and high signal-to-noise (S/N = 150-300) and were obtained with the FEROS spectrograph on the ESO 1.5 m and 2.2 m telescopes, the SOFIN and FIES spectrographs on the Nordic Optical Telescope, the UVES spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope, the HARPS spectrograph on the ESO 3.6 m telescope, and the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan Clay telescope. The abundances from individual Fe i lines were were corrected for non-LTE effects in every step of the analysis. Results: We present stellar parameters, stellar ages, kinematical parameters, orbital parameters, and detailed elemental abundances for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y, and Ba for 714 nearby F and G dwarf stars. Our data show that there is an old and {$\alpha$}-enhanced disk population, and a younger and less {$\alpha$}-enhanced disk population. While they overlap greatly in metallicity between -0.7 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$\lessequivlnt$} +0.1, they show a bimodal distribution in [{$\alpha$}/Fe]. This bimodality becomes even clearer if stars where stellar parameters and abundances show larger uncertainties (Teff {$\lessequivlnt$} 5400 K) are discarded, showing that it is important to constrain the data set to a narrow range in the stellar parameters if small differences between stellar populations are to be revealed. In addition, we find that the {$\alpha$}-enhanced population has orbital parameters placing the stellar birthplaces in the inner Galactic disk while the low-{$\alpha$} stars mainly come from the outer Galactic disk, fully consistent with the recent claims of a short scale-length for the {$\alpha$}-enhanced Galactic thick disk. We have also investigated the properties of the Hercules stream and the Arcturus moving group and find that neither of them presents chemical or age signatures that could suggest that they are disrupted clusters or extragalactic accretion remnants from ancient merger events. Instead, they are most likely dynamical features originating within the Galaxy. We have also discovered that a standard 1D, LTE analysis, utilising ionisation and excitation balance of Fe i and Fe ii lines produces a flat lower main sequence. As the exact cause for this effect is unclear we chose to apply an empirical correction. Turn-off stars and more evolved stars appear to be unaffected.

The spectra have high resolution (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} = 40 000-110 000) and high signal-to-noise (\emph{S{$<$}i/{$>$}/\emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$} = 150-300) and were obtained with the FEROS spectrograph on the ESO 1.5 m and 2.2 m telescopes, the SOFIN and FIES spectrographs on the Nordic Optical Telescope, the UVES spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope, the HARPS spectrograph on the ESO 3.6 m telescope, and the MIKE spectrograph on the \emph{Magellan {$<$}i/{$>$}Clay telescope. The abundances from individual Fe i lines were were corrected for non-LTE effects in every step of the analysis. \emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}We present stellar parameters, stellar ages, kinematical parameters, orbital parameters, and detailed elemental abundances for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y, and Ba for 714 nearby F and G dwarf stars. Our data show that there is an old and \emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$}-enhanced disk population, and a younger and less \emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$}-enhanced disk population. While they overlap greatly in metallicity between -0.7 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$\lessequivlnt$} +0.1, they show a bimodal distribution in [\emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$}/Fe]. This bimodality becomes even clearer if stars where stellar parameters and abundances show larger uncertainties (\emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 5400 K) are discarded, showing that it is important to constrain the data set to a narrow range in the stellar parameters if small differences between stellar populations are to be revealed. In addition, we find that the \emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$}-enhanced population has orbital parameters placing the stellar birthplaces in the inner Galactic disk while the low-\emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$} stars mainly come from the outer Galactic disk, fully consistent with the recent claims of a short scale-length for the \emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$}-enhanced Galactic thick disk. We have also investigated the properties of the Hercules stream and the Arcturus moving group and find that neither of them presents chemical or age signatures that could suggest that they are disrupted clusters or extragalactic accretion remnants from ancient merger events. Instead, they are most likely dynamical features originating within the Galaxy. We have also discovered that a standard 1D, LTE analysis, utilising ionisation and excitation balance of Fe i and Fe ii lines produces a flat lower main sequence. As the exact cause for this effect is unclear we chose to apply an empirical correction. Turn-off stars and more evolved stars appear to be unaffected.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Observations of circumstellar environments that look for the direct signal of exoplanets and the scattered light from disks have significant instrumental implications. In the past 15 years, major developments in adaptive optics, coronagraphy, optical manufacturing, wavefront sensing, and data processing, together with a consistent global system analysis have brought about a new generation of high-contrast imagers and spectrographs on large ground-based telescopes with much better performance. One of the most productive imagers is the Spectro-Polarimetic High contrast imager for Exoplanets REsearch (SPHERE), which was designed and built for the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. SPHERE includes an extreme adaptive optics system, a highly stable common path interface, several types of coronagraphs, and three science instruments. Two of them, the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) and the Infra-Red Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS), were designed to efficiently cover the near-infrared range in a single observation for an efficient search of young planets. The third instrument, ZIMPOL, was designed for visible polarimetric observation to look for the reflected light of exoplanets and the light scattered by debris disks. These three scientific instruments enable the study of circumstellar environments at unprecedented angular resolution, both in the visible and the near-infrared. In this work, we thoroughly present SPHERE and its on-sky performance after four years of operations at the VLT.},

  abstract = {Methods. Using the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the Unit 2 (UT2) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), we analyzed the spectra of 89 cluster members, both class II (82) and class III (7) stars. We measured the strength of the lithium line at {$\lambda$}6707.8 {\AA} and derived the abundance of this element through equivalent width measurements and curves of growth. For six class II stars we also derived the iron and barium abundances using the spectral synthesis method and the code MOOG. The veiling contribution was taken into account in the abundance analysis for all three elements. Results. We find a dispersion in the strength of the lithium line at low effective temperatures and identify three targets with severe Li depletion. The nuclear age inferred for these highly lithium-depleted stars is around 15 Myr, which exceeds by an order of magnitude the isochronal one. We derive a nearly solar metallicity for the members whose spectra could be analyzed. We find that Ba is over-abundant by {$\sim$}0.7 dex with respect to the Sun. Since current theoretical models cannot reproduce this abundance pattern, we investigated whether this unusually large Ba content might be related to effects due to stellar parameters, stellar activity, and accretion. Conclusions. We are unable to firmly assess whether the dispersion in the lithium content we observe is a consequence of an age spread. As in other star-forming regions, no metal-rich members are found in Lupus, giving support to a recent hypothesis that the iron abundance distribution of most of the nearby young regions could be the result of a common and widespread star formation episode involving the Galactic thin disk. Among the possible causes or sources for Ba enhancement examined here, none is sufficient to account for the over-abundance of this element at a {$\sim$}0.7 dex level.},

  abstract = {Giant exoplanets seem to have on average a much larger heavy element content than the solar system giants. Past attempts to explain these heavy element contents include collisions between planets, accretion of volatile rich gas and accretion of gas enriched in micro-metre sized solids. However, these different theories individually could not explain the heavy element content of giants and the volatile to refractory ratios in atmospheres of giant planets at the same time. Here we combine the approaches of gas accretion enhanced with vapor and small micro-meter sized dust grains. As pebbles drift inwards, the volatile component evaporates and enriches the disc, while the smaller silicate core of the pebble continues to move inwards. The smaller silicate pebbles drift slower, leading to a pile-up of material interior to the water ice line, increasing the dust-to-gas ratio interior to the ice line. Under the assumption that these small dust grains follow the motion of the gas, gas accreting giants accrete large fractions of small solids in addition to the volatile vapor. The effectiveness of the solid enrichment requires a large disc radius to maintain the pebble flux for a long time and a large viscosity that reduces the size and inward drift of the small dust grains. However, this process depends crucially on the debated size difference of the pebbles interior and exterior of the water ice line. On the other hand, the volatile component released by the inward drifting pebbles can lead to a large enrichment with heavy element vapor, independently of a size difference of pebbles interior and exterior to the water ice line. Our model stresses the importance of the disc's radius and viscosity on the enrichment of dust and vapor. Consequently we show how our model could explain the heavy element content of the majority of giant planets by using combined estimates of dust and vapor enrichment.},

  abstract = {Giant planets migrate though the protoplanetary disc as they grow their solid core and attract their gaseous envelope. Previously, we have studied the growth and migration of an isolated planet in an evolving disc. Here, we generalise such models to include the mutual gravitational interaction between a high number of growing planetary bodies. We have investigated how the formation of planetary systems depends on the radial flux of pebbles through the protoplanetary disc and on the planet migration rate. Our N-body simulations confirm previous findings that Jupiter-like planets in orbits outside the water ice line originate from embryos starting out at 20--40 AU when using nominal type-I and type-II migration rates and a pebble flux of approximately 100--200 Earth masses per million years, enough to grow Jupiter within the lifetime of the solar nebula. The planetary embryos placed up to 30 AU migrate into the inner system (rP {$<$} 1AU). There they form super-Earths or hot and warm gas giants, producing systems that are inconsistent with the configuration of the solar system, but consistent with some exoplanetary systems. We also explored slower migration rates which allow the formation of gas giants from embryos originating from the 5--10 AU region, which are stranded exterior to 1 AU at the end of the gas-disc phase. These giant planets can also form in discs with lower pebbles fluxes (50--100 Earth masses per Myr). We identify a pebble flux threshold below which migration dominates and moves the planetary core to the inner disc, where the pebble isolation mass is too low for the planet to accrete gas efficiently. In our model, giant planet growth requires a sufficiently high pebble flux to enable growth to out-compete migration. An even higher pebble flux produces systems with multiple gas giants. We show that planetary embryos starting interior to 5 AU do not grow into gas giants, even if migration is slow and the pebble flux is large. These embryos instead grow to just a few Earth masses, the mass regime of super-Earths. This stunted growth is caused by the low pebble isolation mass in the inner disc and is therefore independent of the pebble flux. Additionally, we show that the long-term evolution of our formed planetary systems can naturally produce systems with inner super-Earths and outer gas giants as well as systems of giant planets on very eccentric orbits.},

  abstract = {Giant planets migrate though the protoplanetary disc as they grow their solid core and attract their gaseous envelope. Previously, we have studied the growth and migration of an isolated planet in an evolving disc. Here, we generalise such models to include the mutual gravitational interaction between a high number of growing planetary bodies. We have investigated how the formation of planetary systems depends on the radial flux of pebbles through the protoplanetary disc and on the planet migration rate. Our N-body simulations confirm previous findings that Jupiter-like planets in orbits outside the water ice line originate from embryos starting out at 20-40 AU when using nominal type-I and type-II migration rates and a pebble flux of approximately 100-200 Earth masses per million years, enough to grow Jupiter within the lifetime of the solar nebula. The planetary embryos placed up to 30 AU migrate into the inner system (rP {$<$} 1AU). There they form super-Earths or hot and warm gas giants, producing systems that are inconsistent with the configuration of the solar system, but consistent with some exoplanetary systems. We also explored slower migration rates which allow the formation of gas giants from embryos originating from the 5-10 AU region, which are stranded exterior to 1 AU at the end of the gas-disc phase. These giant planets can also form in discs with lower pebbles fluxes (50-100 Earth masses per Myr). We identify a pebble flux threshold below which migration dominates and moves the planetary core to the inner disc, where the pebble isolation mass is too low for the planet to accrete gas efficiently.

  abstract = {Multiple codes are available to derive atmospheric parameters and individual chemical abundances from high-resolution spectra of AFGKM stars. Almost all spectroscopists have their own preferences regarding which code and method to use. But the intrinsic differences between codes and methods lead to complex systematics that depend on multiple variables such as the selected spectral regions and the radiative transfer code used. I expand ISPEC, a popular open-source spectroscopic tool, to support the most well-known radiative transfer codes and assess their similarities and biases when using multiple set-ups based on the equivalentwidth method and the synthetic spectral-fitting technique (interpolating from a pre-computed grid of spectra or synthesizing with interpolated model atmospheres). This work shows that systematic differences on atmospheric parameters and abundances between most of the codes can be reduced when using the same method and executing a careful spectral feature selection. However, it may not be possible to ignore the remaining differences, depending on the particular case and the required precision. Regarding methods, equivalent-width-based and spectrumfitting analyses exhibit large differences that are caused by their intrinsic differences, which is significant given the popularity of these two methods. The results help to identify the key caveats of modern spectroscopy that all scientists should be aware of before trusting their own results or being tempted to combine atmospheric parameters and abundances from the literature.},

  abstract = {We report on new high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy on the multiple T Tauri star system V773 Tau over the 2003--2009 period. With these data we derive relative astrometry, photometry between the A and B components, and radial velocity (RV) of the A-subsystem components. Combining these new data with previously published astrometry and RVs, we update the relative A--B orbit model. This updated orbit model, the known system distance, and A-subsystem parameters yield a dynamical mass for the B component for the first time. Remarkably, the derived B dynamical mass is in the range 1.7--3.0 M . This is much higher than previous estimates and suggests that like A, B is also a multiple stellar system. Among these data, spatially resolved spectroscopy provides new insight into the nature of the B component. Similar to A, these near-IR spectra indicate that the dominant source in B is of mid-K spectral type. If B is in fact a multiple star system as suggested by the dynamical mass estimate, the simplest assumption is that B is composed of similar {$\sim$}1.2 M pre-main-sequence stars in a close ({$<$}1 AU) binary system. This inference is supported by line-shape changes in near-IR spectroscopy of B, tentatively interpreted as changing RV among components in V773 Tau B. Relative photometry indicates that B is highly variable in the near-IR. The most likely explanation for this variability is circum-B material resulting in variable line-of-sight extinction. The distribution of this material must be significantly affected by both the putative B multiplicity and the A--B orbit.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context. {$<$}i/{$>$}The effects of a planet sculpting the disk from which it formed are most likely to be found in disks that are in transition between being classical protoplanetary and debris disks. Recent direct imaging of transition disks has revealed structures such as dust rings, gaps, and spiral arms, but an unambiguous link between these structures and sculpting planets is yet to be found. \emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}We aim to find signs of ongoing planet-disk interaction and study the distribution of small grains at the surface of the transition disk around RX J1615.3-3255 (RX J1615). \emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We observed RX J1615 with VLT/SPHERE. From these observations, we obtained polarimetric imaging with ZIMPOL (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>\prime$}-band) and IRDIS (\emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$}), and IRDIS (\emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}2\emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}3) dual-band imaging with simultaneous spatially resolved spectra with the IFS (\emph{YJ{$<$}i/{$>$}). \emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}We image the disk for the first time in scattered light and detect two arcs, two rings, a gap and an inner disk with marginal evidence for an inner cavity. The shapes of the arcs suggest that they are probably segments of full rings. Ellipse fitting for the two rings and inner disk yield a disk inclination \emph{i{$<$}i/{$>$} = 47 {\textpm} 2{$^\circ$} and find semi-major axes of 1.50 {\textpm} 0.01{$\prime\prime$} (278 au), 1.06 {\textpm} 0.01{$\prime\prime$} (196 au) and 0.30 {\textpm} 0.01{$\prime\prime$} (56 au), respectively. We determine the scattering surface height above the midplane, based on the projected ring center offsets. Nine point sources are detected between 2.1{$\prime\prime$} and 8.0{$\prime\prime$} separation and considered as companion candidates. With NACO data we recover four of the nine point sources, which we determine to be not co-moving, and therefore unbound to the system. \emph{Conclusions. {$<$}i/{$>$}We present the first detection of the transition disk of RX J1615 in scattered light. The height of the rings indicate limited flaring of the disk surface, which enables partial self-shadowing in the disk. The outermost arc either traces the bottom of the disk or it is another ring with semi-major axis {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2.35{$\prime\prime$} (435 au). We explore both scenarios, extrapolating the complete shape of the feature, which will allow us to distinguish between the two in future observations. The most attractive scenario, where the arc traces the bottom of the outer ring, requires the disk to be truncated at \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 360 au. If the closest companion candidate is indeed orbiting the disk at 540 au, then it would be the most likely cause for such truncation. This companion candidate, as well as the remaining four, all require follow up observations to determine if they are bound to the system.}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Methods. Our survey is carried out with VLT/SPHERE with short exposure sequences on the order of 5 min per star per filter. The subtraction of the stellar point spread function (PSF) is based on reference star differential imaging using the other targets (with similar colors and magnitudes) in the survey in combination with principal component analysis. Two astrometric epochs that are separated by more than one year are used to confirm co-moving companions by proper motion analysis. Results. We report the discovery of YSES 2b, a co-moving, planetary-mass companion to the K1 star YSES 2 (TYC 8984-2245-1, 2MASS J11275535-6626046). The primary has a Gaia EDR3 distance of 110 pc, and we derive a revised mass of 1.1 M and an age of approximately 14 Myr. We detect the companion in two observing epochs southwest of the star at a position angle of 205{\textopenbullet} and with a separation of {$\sim$}1. 05, which translates to a minimum physical separation of 115 au at the distance of the system. Photometric measurements in the H and Ks bands are indicative of a late L spectral type, similar to the innermost planets around HR 8799.

We discuss potential formation mechanisms and find that the current position of the planet is compatible with formation by disk gravitational instability, but its mass is lower than expected from numerical simulations. Formation via core accretion must have occurred closer to the star, yet we do not find evidence that supports the required outward migration, such as via scattering off another undiscovered companion in the system. We can exclude additional companions with masses greater than 13 MJup in the full field of view of the detector (0. 15 {$<$} {$\rho$} {$<$} 5. 50), at 0. 5 we can rule out further objects that are more massive than 6 MJup, and for projected separations {$\rho$} {$>$} 2 we are sensitive to planets with masses as low as 2 MJup. Conclusions. YSES 2b is an ideal target for follow-up observations to further the understanding of the physical and chemical formation mechanisms of wide-orbit Jovian planets. The YSES strategy of short snapshot observations ({$\leq$}5 min) and PSF subtraction based on a large reference library proves to be extremely efficient and should be considered for future direct imaging surveys.},

  abstract = {The chance that a planetary system will interact with another member of its host star's nascent cluster would be greatly increased if gas giant planets form in situ on wide orbits. In this paper, we explore the outcomes of planet--planet scattering for a distribution of multi-planet systems that all have one of the planets on an initial orbit of 100 AU. The scattering experiments are run with and without stellar flybys. We convolve the outcomes with distributions for protoplanetary disk and stellar cluster sizes to generalize the results where possible. We find that the frequencies of large mutual inclinations and high eccentricities are sensitive to the number of planets in a system, but not strongly to stellar flybys. However, flybys do play a role in changing the low and moderate portions of the mutual inclination distributions, and erase dynamically cold initial conditions on average. Wide-orbit planets can be mixed throughout the planetary system, and in some cases, can potentially become hot Jupiters, which we demonstrate using scattering experiments that include a tidal damping model. If planets form in situ on wide orbits, then there will be discernible differences in the proper-motion distributions of a sample of wide-orbit planets compared with a pure scattering formation mechanism. Stellar flybys can enhance the frequency of ejections in planetary systems, but autoionization is likely to remain the dominant source of free-floating planets.},

  abstract = {The meter-per-second precision achieved by today's velocimeters enables us to search for 1-10 M{$\oplus$} planets in the habitable zone of cool stars. This paper reports on the detection of three planets orbiting GJ 163 (HIP 19394), a M3 dwarf monitored by our ESO/HARPS search for planets. We made use of the HARPS spectrograph to collect 150 radial velocities of GJ 163 over a period of eight years. We searched the radial-velocity time series for coherent signals and found five distinct periodic variabilities. We investigated the stellar activity and called into question the planetary interpretation for two signals. Before more data can be acquired we concluded that at least three planets are orbiting GJ 163. They have orbital periods of Pb = 8.632 {\textpm} 0.002, Pc = 25.63 {\textpm} 0.03, and Pd = 604 {\textpm} 8 days and minimum masses msini = 10.6 {\textpm} 0.6, 6.8 {\textpm} 0.9, and 29 {\textpm} 3 M{$\oplus$}, respectively. We hold our interpretations for the two additional signals with periods P(e) = 19.4 and P(f) = 108 days. The inner pair presents an orbital period ratio of 2.97, but a dynamical analysis of the system shows that it lays outside the 3:1 mean motion resonance. The planet GJ 163c, in particular, is a super-Earth with an equilibrium temperature of Teq = (302 {\textpm} 10)(1 - A)1/4 K and may lie in the so-called habitable zone for albedo values (A = 0.34 - 0.89) moderately higher than that of Earth (A{$\oplus$} = 0.2-0.3).

  abstract = {The combination of high-contrast imaging and high-dispersion spectroscopy, which has successfully been use to detect the atmosphere of a giant planet, is one of the most promising potential probes of the atmosphere of Earth-size worlds. The forthcoming generation of extremely large telescopes (ELTs) may obtain sufficient contrast with this technique to detect O2 in the atmosphere of those worlds that orbit low-mass M dwarfs. This is strong motivation to carry out a census of planets around cool stars for which habitable zones can be resolved by ELTs, i.e. for M dwarfs within {$\sim$}5 parsec. Our HARPS survey has been a major contributor to that sample of nearby planets. Here we report on our radial velocity observations of Ross 128 (Proxima Virginis, GJ447, HIP 57548), an M4 dwarf just 3.4 parsec away from our Sun. This source hosts an exo-Earth with a projected mass m sin i = 1.35 M{$\oplus$} and an orbital period of 9.9 days. Ross 128 b receives less than 1.5 times as much flux as Earth from the Sun and its equilibrium ranges in temperature between 269 K for an Earth-like albedo and 213 K for a Venus-like albedo. Recent studies place it close to the inner edge of the conventional habitable zone. An 80-day long light curve from K2 campaign C01 demonstrates that Ross 128 b does not transit. Together with the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) photometry and spectroscopic activity indices, the K2 photometry shows that Ross 128 rotates slowly and has weak magnetic activity. In a habitability context, this makes survival of its atmosphere against erosion more likely. Ross 128 b is the second closest known exo-Earth, after Proxima Centauri b (1.3 parsec), and the closest temperate planet known around a quiet star. The 15 mas planet-star angular separation at maximum elongation will be resolved by ELTs ({$>$}3{$\lambda$}/D) in the optical bands of O2.},

  abstract = {A self-consistent calculation of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolution was carried out, including nucleosynthesis at the base of the convective envelope (hot bottom burning). Hot bottom burning was found to occur for stars between approximately 4.5 and approximately 7 solar mass, producing envelopes with O-18/O-16 less than or equal to 10-6 and 10-3 approximately less than or equal O-17/O-16 approximately less than or equal to 10-1. The O-17 abundance depends sensitively on the nuclear O-17-destruction rate; this rate is only loosely constrained by the requirement that first and second dredge-up models match O-isotope observations of red giant branch (RGB) stars (Boothroyd, Sackmann, \& Wasserburg 1994). In some cases, high mass-loss rates can terminate hot bottom burning before further O-17 enrichment takes place or even before all O-18 is destroyed. These predictions are in accord with the very limited stellar observations of J type carbon stars on the AGB and with some of the circumstellar Al2O3 grains from meteorites. In contrast, precise data from a number of grains and data from most low-mass S and C AGB stars (approximately less than 1.7 solar mass) lie in a region of the O-18/O-16 versus O-17/O-16 diagram that is not accessible by first and second dredge-up or by hot bottom burning. We conclude that for AGB stars, the standard models of stellar evolution are not in accord with these observations. We surmise that an additional mixing mechanism must exist that transports material from the cool bottom of the stellar convective envelope to a depth at which O-18 is destroyed. This 'cool bottom processing' mechanism on the AGB is similar to extra mixing mechanisms proposed to explain the excess C-13 (and depleted C-12) observed in the earlier RGB stage of evolution and the large Li-7 depletion observed in low-mass main-sequence stars.},

  pages = {19},
  abstract = {Methods. Using our gas-grain chemical code, we performed a parameter exploration and follow the CO abundance evolution over a range of conditions representative of shielded disk midplanes. Results. Consistent with previous studies, we find that no chemical processing of CO takes place on 1--3 Myr timescales for low cosmic-ray ionisation rates, {$<$}5 {\texttimes} 10-18 s-1. Assuming an ionisation rate of 10-17 s-1, more than 90\% of the CO is converted into other species, but only in the cold parts of the disk below 30 K. This order of magnitude destruction of CO is robust against the choice of grain-surface reaction rate parameters, such as the tunnelling efficiency and diffusion barrier height, for temperatures between 20 and 30 K. Below 20 K there is a strong dependence on the assumed efficiency of H tunnelling. Conclusions. The low temperatures needed for CO chemical processing indicate that the exact disk temperature structure is important, with warm disks around luminous Herbig stars expected to have little to no CO conversion. In contrast, for cold disks around sun-like T Tauri stars, a large fraction of the emitting CO layer is affected unless the disks are young ({$<$}1 Myr). This can lead to inferred gas masses that are up to two orders of magnitude lower. Moreover, unless CO is locked up early in large grains, the volatile carbon composition of the icy pebbles and planetesimals forming in the midplane and drifting to the inner disk will be dominated by CH3OH, CO2 and/or hydrocarbons.},

  abstract = {Doppler surveys have shown that more massive stars have significantly higher frequencies of giant planets inside {$\sim$}3 AU than lower mass stars, consistent with giant planet formation by core accretion. Direct imaging searches have begun to discover significant numbers of giant planet candidates around stars with masses of {$\sim$}1 M{$\Sun$} to {$\sim$}2 M{$\Sun$} at orbital distances of {$\sim$}20 AU to {$\sim$}120 AU. Given the inability of core accretion to form giant planets at such large distances, gravitational instabilities of the gas disk leading to clump formation have been suggested as the more likely formation mechanism. Here, we present five new models of the evolution of disks with inner radii of 20 AU and outer radii of 60 AU, for central protostars with masses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 M{$\Sun$}, in order to assess the likelihood of planet formation on wide orbits around stars with varied masses. The disk masses range from 0.028 M{$\Sun$} to 0.21 M{$\Sun$}, with initial Toomre Q stability values ranging from 1.1 in the inner disks to {$\sim$}1.6 in the outer disks. These five models show that disk instability is capable of forming clumps on timescales of {$\sim$}103 yr that, if they survive for longer times, could form giant planets initially on orbits with semimajor axes of {$\sim$}30 AU to {$\sim$}70 AU and eccentricities of {$\sim$}0 to {$\sim$}0.35, with initial masses of {$\sim$}1 MJup to {$\sim$}5 MJup, around solar-type stars, with more protoplanets forming as the mass of the protostar (and protoplanetary disk) is increased. In particular, disk instability appears to be a likely formation mechanism for the HR 8799 gas giant planetary system.},

  abstract = {Doppler spectroscopy of nearby stars has shown that extrasolar gas giant planets often have masses considerably in excess of that of Jupiter, while observations of young stars imply that the gaseous portions of protoplanetary disks have lifetimes typically of no more than a few million years. Both discoveries raise questions about the universality of the mechanism long favored for Jupiter formation: core accretion. Forming Jupiter by core accretion requires a gas surface density at 5 AU of about 103 g cm-2. Combined with midplane temperatures cold enough to form comets ({$<$}50 K), this leads to a marginally gravitationally unstable gas disk. High spatial resolution, three-dimensional hydrodynamical models of "locally isothermal" disks have shown that gas giant protoplanets may form in such a marginally unstable disk, with masses comparable to the more massive extrasolar planets, and well within expected disk lifetimes. However, locally isothermal models err on the side of encouraging protoplanetary clumps to form, whereas models by other workers using less permissive thermodynamical assumptions have suggested that clump formation is prohibited. We present three-dimensional models with an approximate treatment of heating and cooling, including radiative transfer in the diffusion approximation, that show that disk instability can still proceed in much the same manner as in locally isothermal models because the timescale for significant nebular cooling is comparable to that for the instability to grow, i.e., an orbital period. The models suggest that disk instability remains as a likely means for the widespread formation of gas giant planets. Core accretion apparently requires exceptionally long-lived disks to form Jupiters and so would predict that gas giant planets are relatively rare. If the disk instability mechanism can occur, however, extrasolar gas giant planets should be relatively abundant.},

We have measured C and N abundances and 12C/13C ratios for a sample of 63 solar twins spanning a wide range in age, based on spectral synthesis of a comprehensive list of CH\,A-X and CN\,B-X features using HARPS spectra. The analysis of 55 thin disc solar twins confirms the dependences of [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] on [Fe/H]. [N/Fe] is investigated as a function of [Fe/H] and age for the first time for these stars. Our derived correlation [C/Fe]--age agrees with works for solar-type stars and solar twins, but the [N/Fe]--age correlation does not. The relations [C,N/Fe]--[Fe/H] and [C,N/Fe]--age for the solar twins lay under solar. 12C/13C is found correlated with [Fe/H] and seems to have decreased along the evolution of the local thin disc. Predictions from chemical evolution models for the solar vicinity corroborate the relations [C,N/Fe]--[Fe/H], 12C/13C--age, and [N/O]--[O/H], but do not for the 12C/13C--[Fe/H] and [C/O]--[O/H] relations. The N/O ratio in the Sun is placed at the high end of the homogeneous distribution of solar twins, which suggests uniformity in the N--O budget for the formation of icy planetesimals, watery superearths, and giant planets. C and N had different nucleosynthetic origins along the thin disc evolution, as shown by the relations of [C/N], [C/O], and [N/O] against [O/H] and age. [C/N] and [C/O] are particularly observed increasing in time for solar twins younger than the Sun.},

In the time since Protostars and Planets V (Reipurth et al., 2007) (PPV), there have been major developments in the availability of rotation-period measurements at multiple ages and in different star-forming environments that are essential for testing theory. In parallel, substantial theoretical developments have been carried out in the last few years, including the physics of the star-disk interaction, numerical simulations of stellar winds, and the investigation of angular momentum transport processes in stellar interiors. This chapter reviews both the recent observational and theoretical advances that prompted the development of renewed angular momentum evolution models for cool stars and brown dwarfs. While the main observational trends of the rotational history of low-mass objects seem to be accounted for by these new models, a number of critical open issues remain that are outlined in this review.},

These updates allow for the accurate prediction of line positions in regions of astrophysical interest, particularly in strong rovibronic bands in the infrared and visible. Previously published ab initio transition dipole moment curves are adjusted based on experimental lifetime measurements, resulting in increased intensities in key regions.

We infer a spectral type of L0 {\textpm} 1, and our spectrum exhibits multiple signs of youth. The most notable feature is exceptionally strong Pa{$\beta$} emission (EW = -11.4 {\textpm} 0.3 {\AA}), which signals the presence of a circumplanetary accretion disk. The luminosity of GSC 06214-00210 b combined with its age yields a model-dependent mass of 14 {\textpm} 2 MJup, making it the lowest-mass companion to show evidence of a disk. With a projected separation of 320 AU, the formation of GSC 06214-00210 b and other very low mass companions on similarly wide orbits is unclear. One proposed mechanism is formation at close separations followed by planet--planet scattering to much larger orbits. Since that scenario involves a close encounter with another massive body, which is probably destructive to circumplanetary disks, it is unlikely that GSC 06214-00210 b underwent a scattering event in the past. This implies that planet--planet scattering is not solely responsible for the population of gas giants on wide orbits. More generally, the identification of disks around young planetary companions on wide orbits offers a novel method to constrain the formation pathway of these objects, which is otherwise notoriously difficult to do for individual systems. We also refine the spectral type of the primary from M1 to K7 and detect a mild (2{$\sigma$}) excess at 22 {$\mu$}m using Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer photometry.},

  abstract = {The orientation between a star's spin axis and a planet's orbital plane provides valuable information about the system's formation and dynamical history. For non-transiting planets at wide separations, true stellar obliquities are challenging to measure, but lower limits on spin--orbit orientations can be determined from the difference between the inclination of the star's rotational axis and the companion's orbital plane ({$\Delta$}i). We present results of a uniform analysis of rotation periods, stellar inclinations, and obliquities of cool stars (SpT {$\greaterequivlnt$} F5) hosting directly imaged planets and brown dwarf companions. As part of this effort, we have acquired new values for 22 host stars with the high-resolution Tull spectrograph at the Harlan J. Smith telescope. Altogether our sample contains 62 host stars with rotation periods, most of which are newly measured using light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Among these, 53 stars have inclinations determined from projected rotational and equatorial velocities, and 21 stars predominantly hosting brown dwarfs have constraints on {$\Delta$}i. Eleven of these (52\% of the sample) are likely misaligned, while the remaining 10 host stars are consistent with spin--orbit alignment. As an ensemble, the minimum obliquity distribution between 10 and 250 au is more consistent with a mixture of isotropic and aligned systems than either extreme scenario alone---pointing to direct cloud collapse, formation within disks bearing primordial alignments and misalignments, or architectures processed by dynamical evolution. This contrasts with stars hosting directly imaged planets, which show a preference for low obliquities. These results reinforce an emerging distinction between the orbits of long-period brown dwarfs and giant planets in terms of their stellar obliquities and orbital eccentricities.},

  abstract = {We present interferometric angular diameter measurements of 21 low-mass, K- and M-dwarfs made with the CHARA Array. This sample is enhanced by adding a collection of radius measurements published in the literature to form a total data set of 33 K--M-dwarfs with diameters measured to better than 5\%. We use these data in combination with the Hipparcos parallax and new measurements of the star's bolometric flux to compute absolute luminosities, linear radii, and effective temperatures for the stars. We develop empirical relations for {$\sim$}K0 to M4 main-sequence stars that link the stellar temperature, radius, and luminosity to the observed (B - V), (V - R), (V - I), (V - J), (V - H), and (V - K) broadband color index and stellar metallicity [Fe/H]. These relations are valid for metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = -0.5 to +0.1 dex and are accurate to {$\sim$}2\%, {$\sim$}5\%, and {$\sim$}4\% for temperature, radius, and luminosity, respectively. Our results show that it is necessary to use metallicity-dependent transformations in order to properly convert colors into stellar temperatures, radii, and luminosities. Alternatively, we find no sensitivity to metallicity on relations we construct to the global properties of a star omitting color information, e.g., temperature--radius and temperature--luminosity. Thus, we are able to empirically quantify to what order the star's observed color index is impacted by the stellar iron abundance. In addition to the empirical relations, we also provide a representative look-up table via stellar spectral classifications using this collection of data. Robust examinations of single star temperatures and radii compared to evolutionary model predictions on the luminosity--temperature and luminosity--radius planes reveal that models overestimate the temperatures of stars with surface temperatures {$<$}5000 K by {$\sim$}3\%, and underestimate the radii of stars with radii {$<$}0.7 R{$\Sun$} by {$\sim$}5\%. These conclusions additionally suggest that the models over account for the effects that the stellar metallicity may have on the astrophysical properties of an object. By comparing the interferometrically measured radii for the single star population to those of eclipsing binaries, we find that for a given mass, single and binary star radii are indistinguishable. However, we also find that for a given radius, the literature temperatures for binary stars are systematically lower compared to our interferometrically derived temperatures of single stars by {$\sim$}200 to 300 K. The nature of this offset is dependent on the validation of binary star temperatures, where bringing all measurements to a uniform and correctly calibrated temperature scale is needed to identify any influence stellar activity may have on the physical properties of a star. Lastly, we present an empirically determined H-R diagram using fundamental properties presented here in combination with those in Boyajian et al. for a total of 74 nearby, main-sequence, A- to M-type stars, and define regions of habitability for the potential existence of sub-stellar mass companions in each system.},

Cooling models have been used to estimate a mass in the range of 20--55 , much lower than our measured value.

Future Gaia data releases will confirm the reliability of the absolute astrometry, though the data pass all quality checks in both Hipparcos and Gaia. Our dynamical mass implies a very old age for Gl 229, in some tension with kinematic and activity age indicators, and/or shortcomings in brown dwarf cooling models.

The temperature profile of the disk governs the condensation fronts of various compounds, and although these chemically distinct regions migrate and mix during the disk lifetime, they can still leave an imprint on the compositions of the forming planets. Observable atmospheric compositions of hot Jupiters, when compared against their host stars, could potentially constrain their formation and migration processes. We compared the measured planetary and stellar abundances of carbon and oxygen for 10 systems with hot Jupiters. If the planets formed by core accretion with significant planetesimal accretion and migrated through the disk, the hot Jupiter atmospheres should be substantially super-stellar in O/H and substellar in C/O. On the contrary, however, we find that currently reported abundances of hot Jupiters have generally super-stellar C/O ratios, although present uncertainties on the reported O/H and C/O ratios are too large to reach a firm conclusion. In one case, HD~209458b, however, the elevated C/O and depleted O/H of the planet compared to the host star are significant enough to suggest an origin far beyond the ice line, with predominantly gas accretion and subsequent disk-free migration. Improved measurements from the               James Webb Space Telescope               will enable more precise measurements for more hot Jupiters, and we predict, based on the current marginal trend, that a sizable fraction of hot Jupiters will show enrichment of C/O over and lower O/H than their hosts, similar to HD~209458b.},

The combined false-alarm probability is 0.015. The variation is most likely caused by hot spots on the surface of GQ Lup A.

Radial velocity data also contains this period but is inconclusive. Nevertheless, the RV data supports the interpretation that hot spots cause the photometric variation. We use the known K-band variability, amplitude, and phase of GQ Lup A together with a new image of GQ Lup A+b, taken quasi-simultaneously with our monitoring of the star, to confirm the magnitude and, hence, luminosity of the companion.},

In this context, we also compare the results from an atmospheric retrieval to using a self-consistent model to fit atmospheric parameters.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We applied the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS to our near-infrared SPHERE observations of 51 Eri b in order to retrieve its atmospheric parameters. Additionally, we attempted to reproduce previous results with the retrieval approach and compared the results to self-consistent models using the best-fit parameters from the retrieval as priors.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We present a higher S/N \emph{YH{$<$}i/{$>$} spectrum of the planet and revised \emph{K1K{$<$}i/{$>$}2 photometry (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{K{$<$}i/{$>$}1{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 15.11 {\textpm} 0.04 mag, \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{K{$<$}i/{$>$}2{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 17.11 {\textpm} 0.38 mag). The best-fit parameters obtained using an atmospheric retrieval differ from previous results using self-consistent models. In general, we find that our solutions tend towards cloud-free atmospheres (e.g. log \emph{{$\tau<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{clouds{$<$}sub/{$>$} = -5.20 {\textpm} 1.44). For our 'nominal' model with new data, we find a lower metallicity ([Fe/H] = 0.26 {\textpm} 0.30 dex) and C/O ratio (0.38 {\textpm} 0.09), and a slightly higher effective temperature (\emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 807 {\textpm} 45 K) than previous studies. The surface gravity (log \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$} = 4.05 {\textpm} 0.37) is in agreement with the reported values in the literature within uncertainties.

  abstract = {Context. White-light stellar flares are proxies for some of the most energetic types of flares, but their triggering mechanism is still poorly understood. As they are associated with strong X and ultraviolet emission, their study is particularly relevant to estimate the amount of high-energy irradiation onto the atmospheres of exoplanets, especially those in their stars' habitable zone. Aims: We used the high-cadence, high-photometric capabilities of the CHEOPS and TESS space telescopes to study the detailed morphology of white-light flares occurring in a sample of 130 late-K and M stars, and compared our findings with results obtained at a lower cadence. Methods: We employed dedicated software for the reduction of 3 s cadence CHEOPS data, and adopted the 20 s cadence TESS data reduced by their official processing pipeline. We developed an algorithm to separate multi-peak flare profiles into their components, in order to contrast them to those of single-peak, classical flares. We also exploited this tool to estimate amplitudes and periodicities in a small sample of quasi-periodic pulsation (QPP) candidates. Results: Complex flares represent a significant percentage ({$\greaterequivlnt$}30\%) of the detected outburst events. Our findings suggest that high-impulse flares are more frequent than suspected from lower-cadence data, so that the most impactful flux levels that hit close-in exoplanets might be more time-limited than expected. We found significant differences in the duration distributions of single and complex flare components, but not in their peak luminosity. A statistical analysis of the flare parameter distributions provides marginal support for their description with a log-normal instead of a power-law function, leaving the door open to several flare formation scenarios. We tentatively confirmed previous results about QPPs in high-cadence photometry, report the possible detection of a pre-flare dip, and did not find hints of photometric variability due to an undetected flare background. Conclusions: The high-cadence study of stellar hosts might be crucial to evaluate the impact of their flares on close-in exoplanets, as their impulsive phase emission might otherwise be incorrectly estimated. Future telescopes such as PLATO and Ariel, thanks to their high-cadence capability, will help in this respect. As the details of flare profiles and of the shape of their parameter distributions are made more accessible by continuing to increase the instrument precision and time resolution, the models used to interpret them and their role in star-planet interactions might need to be updated constantly.

Combining these with published rotation rates, we compile 27 PMO spin velocities, 16 of which derive from our NIRSPEC/Keck program. Our data are consistent with spin velocities v scaling with planetary radius R as v {$\propto$} 1/R. We conclude that spin angular momentum is conserved as objects cool and contract over the sampled age range. The PMOs in our sample spin at rates that are approximately an order of magnitude below their break-up values, consistent with the hypothesis that they were spun down by magnetized circum-PMO disks (CPDs) during the formation era at ages {$\lessequivlnt$}a few Myr. There is a factor of 4-5 variation in spin velocity that has yet to be understood theoretically. It also remains to be seen whether spin evolves on timescales {$\greaterequivlnt$}1 Gyr for PMOs, as it does for stars and high-mass brown dwarfs emitting magnetized winds.},

Given its importance for testing planet formation and evolution theories, and for assessing the prospects for habitability among Earth-size exoplanets orbiting the most common type of star in the Galaxy, we present a comprehensive assessment of the age of this system. We collate empirical age constraints based on the color-absolute magnitude diagram, average density, lithium absorption, surface gravity features, metallicity, kinematics, rotation, and magnetic activity; and conclude that TRAPPIST-1 is a transitional thin/thick disk star with an age of 7.6 {\textpm} 2.2 Gyr. The star's color--magnitude position indicates that it is slightly metal-rich, which is consistent with the previously reported near-infrared spectroscopic metallicity; and it has a radius ) that is larger by 8\%--14\% than the predictions of solar-metallicity evolutionary models. We discuss some implications of the old age of this system with regard to the stability and habitability of its planets.},

Because condensate clouds in planetary atmospheres show distinct horizontal structure, we have explored a model for partly cloudy atmospheres in brown dwarfs. Our model successfully reproduces the colors and magnitudes of both L and T dwarfs for the first time, including the unexpected brightening of the early- and mid-type T dwarfs at the J band, provided that clouds are rapidly removed from the photosphere at Teff {$\approx$} 1200 K. The clearing of cloud layers also explains the surprising persistence and strengthening of gaseous FeH bands in early- and mid-type T dwarfs. The breakup of cloud layers is likely driven by convection in the troposphere, analogous to phenomena observed on Jupiter. Our results demonstrate that planetary-like atmospheric dynamics must be considered when examining the evolution of free-floating brown dwarfs.},

  abstract = {Using a model for refractory clouds, a novel algorithm for handling them, and the latest gas-phase molecular opacities, we have produced a new series of L and T dwarf spectral and atmosphere models as a function of gravity and metallicity, spanning the Teff range from 2200 to 700 K. The correspondence with observed spectra and infrared colors for early and mid-L dwarfs and for mid- to late T dwarfs is good. We find that the width in infrared color-magnitude diagrams of both the T and L dwarf branches is naturally explained by reasonable variations in gravity and therefore that gravity is the ``second parameter" of the L-T dwarf sequence. We investigate the dependence of theoretical dwarf spectra and color-magnitude diagrams on various cloud properties, such as particle size and cloud spatial distribution. In the region of the L {$\rightarrow$} T transition, we find that no single combination of cloud particle size and gravity can be made to fit all the observed data. Our results suggest that current ignorance of detailed cloud meteorology renders ambiguous the extraction of various physical quantities such as Teff and gravity for mid-L to early T dwarfs. Nevertheless, for decreasing Teff, we capture with some accuracy the major spectral features and signatures observed. We speculate that the subdwarf branch of the L dwarfs would be narrower in effective temperature and that for low enough metallicity the L dwarfs would disappear altogether as a spectroscopic class. Furthermore, we note that the new, lower solar oxygen abundances of Allende-Prieto and coworkers produce better fits to brown dwarf data than do the older values. Finally, we discuss various issues in cloud physics and modeling and speculate on how a better correspondence between theory and observation in the problematic L {$\rightarrow$} T transition region could be achieved.},

Particular topics which are important for an understanding of the spectral properties include the effects of condensates, clouds, molecular abundances, and atomic opacities. Moreover, it discusses the distinctive features of these extrasolar giant planets that are irradiated by a central primary, in particular, their reflection spectra, albedos, and transits.

This planet has an orbital period P = 38.14 days and a low orbital eccentricity. Our Str{\"o}mgren b and y photometry of the host star suggests a stellar rotation signature with a period of P = 60 days. The star is somewhat chromospherically active, with a spot filling factor estimated to be several percent. The rotationally induced 60 day signal, however, is well separated from the period of the radial velocity variations, instilling confidence in the interpretation of a Keplerian origin for the observed velocity variations. Although GJ 687 b produces relatively little specific interest in connection with its individual properties, a compelling case can be argued that it is worthy of remark as an eminently typical, yet at a distance of 4.52 pc, a very nearby representative of the galactic planetary census. The detection of GJ 687 b indicates that the APF telescope is well suited to the discovery of low-mass planets orbiting low-mass stars in the as yet relatively un-surveyed region of the sky near the north celestial pole.},

  abstract = {It is thought that planetary mass companions may form through gravitational disk instabilities or core accretion. Identifying such objects in the process of formation would provide the most direct test for the competing formation theories. One of the most promising candidates for a planetary mass object still in formation is the third object in the FW Tau system. We present here ALMA cycle 1 observations confirming the recently published 1.3 mm detection of a dust disk around this third object and present for the first time a clear detection of a single peak 12CO (2--1) line, providing direct evidence for the simultaneous existence of a gas disk. We perform radiative transfer modeling of the third object in FW Tau and find that current observations are consistent with either a brown dwarf embedded in an edge-on disk or a planet embedded in a low inclination disk, which is externally irradiated by the binary companion. Further observations with ALMA, aiming for high SNR detections of noncontaminated gas lines, are required to conclusively unveil the nature of the third object in FW Tau.},

Fundamental parameters (mass, radius, log(L Bol /L Sun), log(g)) determined from our model agree within 1{$\sigma$} to SED-derived values, except for T eff where our retrieved T eff is approximately 100 K cooler than the evolutionary model-based SED value. We find a retrieved mass of \$\{50\}\_\{-9\}{\textasciicircum}\{+12\}\$ M Jup, however, we also find that the observables of Gl 229B can be explained by a cloud-free model with a prior on mass at the dynamical value, 70 M Jup . We are able to constrain abundances for H2O, CO, CH4, NH3, Na and K and find a supersolar C/O ratio as compared to its primary, Gl 229A. We report an overall subsolar metallicity due to atmospheric oxygen depletion, but find a solar [C/H], which matches that of the primary. We find that this work contributes to a growing trend in retrieval-based studies, particularly for brown dwarfs, toward supersolar C/O ratios and discuss the implications of this result on formation mechanisms and internal physical processes, as well as model biases.},

Through a pair of numerical examples (including mixture modeling of the well-known galaxy data set) we highlight the remarkable diversity of sampling schemes amenable to such recursive normalization, as well as the notable efficiency of the resulting pseudo-mixture distributions for gauging prior sensitivity in the Bayesian model selection context. Our key theoretical contributions are to introduce a novel heuristic (``thermodynamic integration via importance sampling'') for qualifying the role of the bridging sequence in this procedure and to reveal various connections between these recursive estimators and the nested sampling technique.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             We introduce the star-melt\, python package that we developed to facilitate the analysis of time-resolved emission-line spectroscopy of young stellar objects. star-melt automatically extracts, identifies, and fits emission lines. We summarize our analysis methods that utilizes the time domain of high-resolution stellar spectra to investigate variability in the line profiles and corresponding emitting regions. This allows us to probe the innermost disc and accretion structures of YSOs. Local temperatures and densities can be determined using Boltzmann statistics, the Saha equation, and the Sobolev large velocity gradient approximation. star-melt allows for new results to be obtained from archival data, as well as facilitating timely analysis of new data as it is obtained. We present the results of applying star-melt to three YSOs, using spectra from UVES, XSHOOTER, FEROS, HARPS, and ESPaDOnS. We demonstrate what can be achieved for data with disparate time sampling, for stars with different inclinations and variability types. For EX Lupi, we confirm the presence of a localized and stable stellar-surface hotspot associated with the footprint of the accretion column. For GQ Lupi A, we find that the maximum infall rate from an accretion column is correlated with lines produced in the lowest temperatures. For CVSO109. we investigate the rapid temporal variability of a redshifted emission wing, indicative of rotating and infalling material in the inner disc. Our results show that star-melt is a useful tool for such analysis, as well as other applications for emission lines.},

The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations. The validity of the law over a large wavelength interval suggests that the processes which modify the sizes and compositions of grains are stochastic in nature and very efficient.},

Twarog's sample of F stars, for which ages and photometric distances can be determined, is combined with astrometric data to obtain tangential velocities of a set of stars with a large age range. The resulting age-velocity-dispersion relation rises fairly steeply for stars less than 6 Gyr old, thereafter becoming nearly constant with age. These data are consistent with a simple model in which no local disk is initially present, following which stars are born at a constant rate in time and heated by transient spiral waves. The corresponding age-metallicity relation complements this dynamical measure of the formation history of the disk. The use of new stellar models and a revised metallicity calibration leads to quantitative differences from previous work.},

Resulting cloud particle sizes, number densities and material volume fractions are the input for opacity calculations. Results. WASP-39b's atmosphere has a comparable day-night temperature median with sufficiently low temperatures that clouds may form globally. The presence of clouds on WASP-39b can explain observations without resorting to a high ({$>$} 100{\texttimes} solar) metallicity atmosphere for a reduced vertical mixing efficiency. The assessment of mineral ratios shows an under-depletion of S/O due to condensation compared to C/O, Mg/O, Si/O, Fe/O ratios. Vertical patchiness due to heterogeneous cloud composition challenges simple cloud models. An equal mixture of silicates and metal oxides is expected to characterise the cloud top. Further, optical properties of Fe and Mg silicates in the mid-infrared differ significantly which will impact the interpretation of JWST observations. Conclusions. WASP-39b's atmosphere contains clouds and the underdepletion of S/O by atmospheric condensation processes suggest the use of sulphur gas species as a possible link to primordial element abundances. Over-simplified cloud models do not capture the complex nature of mixed-condensate clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. The clouds in the observable upper atmosphere of WASP-39b are a mixture of different silicates and metal oxides. The use of constant particles sizes and/or one-material cloud particles alone to interpret spectra may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity available through JWST observations.},

Metallicities of open clusters are corrected for the effects of the radial gradient, which we find to be -0.09 dex kpc{\textasciicircum}-1 and most likely constant in time. We do not correct for the vertical gradient, because its existence and value are not firmly established. Stars and clusters trace a similar age-metallicity relation, showing an excess of rather metal-rich objects in the age range 5-9 Gyr. Galactic structure studies tend to give a more metal-poor relation than chemical evolution models. Neither relation explains the presence of old, relatively metal-rich stars and clusters. This might be caused by uncertainties in the ages of the local stars, or pre-enrichment of the disc with material from the bulge, possibly as a result of a merger event in the early phases of the formation of our Galaxy.},

  abstract = {In high dispersion spectra of rotating bodies such as stars and planets, the rotation contributes significantly to, and sometimes dominates, the line broadening. We present a simple method for rotationally broadening large wavelength ranges of high-dispersion spectra. The broadening is rapid and scales linearly with the length of the spectrum array. For large wavelength ranges, the method is much faster than the popular convolution-based broadening. We provide the code implementation of this method in a publicly accessible repository.},

  abstract = {New opacity distribution functions (ODFs) for several metallicities have been computed. The main improvements upon previous ODFs computed by Kurucz (1990) are: (1) the replacement of the solar abundances from Anders \& Grevesse (1989) with those from Grevesse \& Sauval (1998); (2) the replacement of the TiO lines provided by Kurucz (1993) with the TiO lines from Schwenke (1998), as distributed by Kurucz (1999a); (3) the addition of the H2O lines from Partridge \& Schwenke (1997), as distributed by Kurucz (1999b); (4) the addition of the H I-H I and H I-H+ quasi-molecular absorptions near 1600{\AA} and 1400{\AA} computed according to Allard et al. (1998). Other minor improvements are related with some changes in a few atomic and molecular data. New grids of ATLAS9 model atmospheres for Teff from 3500 K to 50000 K and log g from 0.0 dex to 5.0 dex have been computed for several metallicities with the new ODFs. Preliminary comparisons of results from the old and new models have shown differences in the energy distributions of stars cooler than 4500 K, in the ultraviolet energy distribution of metal-poor A-type stars, in the U-B and u-b color indices for Teff {$\leq$} 6750 K and in all the color indices for Teff {$\leq$} 4000 K.},

  abstract = {In the framework of the ESO Large Programme ``First Stars'', very high-quality spectra of some 70 very metal-poor dwarfs and giants were obtained with the ESO VLT and UVES spectrograph. These stars are likely to have descended from the first generation(s) of stars formed after the Big Bang, and their detailed composition provides constraints on issues such as the nature of the first supernovae, the efficiency of mixing processes in the early Galaxy, the formation and evolution of the halo of the Galaxy, and the possible sources of reionization of the Universe. This paper presents the abundance analysis of an homogeneous sample of 35 giants selected from the HK survey of Beers et al. ({\textbackslash}cite\{BPS92\}, {\textbackslash}cite\{Be99\}), emphasizing stars of extremely low metallicity: 30 of our 35 stars are in the range -4.1 \&lt;[Fe/H]\&lt; -2.7, and 22 stars have [Fe/H] \&lt; -3.0. Our new VLT/UVES spectra, at a resolving power of R{$\sim$}45 000 and with signal-to-noise ratios of 100-200 per pixel over the wavelength range 330-1000 nm, are greatly superior to those of the classic studies of McWilliam et al. ({\textbackslash}cite\{MPS95\}) and Ryan et al. ({\textbackslash}cite\{RNB96\}). {$<$}P /{$>$}The immediate objective of the work is to determine precise, comprehensive, and homogeneous element abundances for this large sample of the most metal-poor giants presently known. In the analysis we combine the spectral line modeling code ``Turbospectrum'' with OSMARCS model atmospheres, which treat continuum scattering correctly and thus allow proper interpretation of the blue regions of the spectra, where scattering becomes important relative to continuous absorption ({$\lambda$} \&lt; 400 nm). We obtain detailed information on the trends of elemental abundance ratios and the star-to-star scatter around those trends, enabling us to separate the relative contributions of cosmic scatter and observational/analysis errors. {$<$}P /{$>$}Abundances of 17 elements from C to Zn have been measured in all stars, including K and Zn, which have not previously been detected in stars with [Fe/H] \&lt; -3.0. Among the key results, we discuss the oxygen abundance (from the forbidden [OI] line), the different and sometimes complex trends of the abundance ratios with metallicity, the very tight relationship between the abundances of certain elements (e.g., Fe and Cr), and the high [Zn/Fe] ratio in the most metal-poor stars. Within the error bars, the trends of the abundance ratios with metallicity are consistent with those found in earlier literature, but in many cases the scatter around the average trends is much smaller than found in earlier studies, which were limited to lower-quality spectra. We find that the cosmic scatter in several element ratios may be as low as 0.05 dex. {$<$}P /{$>$}The evolution of the abundance trends and scatter with declining metallicity provides strong constraints on the yields of the first supernovae and their mixing into the early ISM. The abundance ratios found in our sample do not match the predicted yields from pair-instability hypernovae, but are consistent with element production by supernovae with progenitor masses up to 100 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}.

  abstract = {The theory of the generalized Doppler effect, concerning the scattering of waves from arbitrary time-varying objects, is still a vide open class of problems. Over the years, two major approaches have been used for the analysis of the Doppler effect: (1) the ``Einstein recipe'' of coordinate transformations and (2) the direct solution of the time-dependent boundary-value problem. In addition, numerous approximate methods have been devised. Some approaches, e.g., the so-called quasi-stationary method, are inherently inconsistent, as explained here. As long as uniform rectilinear motion is involved, we stand on relatively firm ground, and various methods and approximations can be compared and evaluated. For nonuniform motion in the presence of plane waves and plane interfaces (including the logical extension to geometrical optics), some results are available, but the problem already involves heuristic assumptions. Some special problems have been solved for two- and three-dimensional configurations, under very restrictive conditions. The general problem of scattering by a time-varying obstacle is still an open problem. A delineation of some methods for solving such problems numerically is given and discussed.},

We used the IRDIS dual-band imager and the IFS integral field spectrograph of SPHERE to acquire high-contrast coronagraphic differential near-infrared images and spectra of the young A2 star HIP 65426. It is a member of the {$\sim$}17 Myr old Lower Centaurus-Crux association. Results. At a separation of 830 mas (92 au projected) from the star, we detect a faint red companion. Multi-epoch observations confirm that it shares common proper motion with HIP 65426. Spectro-photometric measurements extracted with IFS and IRDIS between 0.95 and 2.2 {\textmu}m indicate a warm, dusty atmosphere characteristic of young low-surface-gravity L5-L7 dwarfs. Hot-start evolutionary models predict a luminosity consistent with a 6--12 MJup, Teff = 1300--1600 K and R = 1.5 {\textpm} 0.1 RJup giant planet. Finally, the comparison with Exo-REM and PHOENIX BT-Settl synthetic atmosphere models gives consistent effective temperatures but with slightly higher surface gravity solutions of log(g) = 4.0--5.0 with smaller radii (1.0--1.3 RJup). Conclusions. Given its physical and spectral properties, HIP 65426 b occupies a rather unique placement in terms of age, mass, and spectral-type among the currently known imaged planets. It represents a particularly interesting case to study the presence of clouds as a function of particle size, composition, and location in the atmosphere, to search for signatures of non-equilibrium chemistry, and finally to test the theory of planet formation and evolution.},

We investigate further the method of Hartigan et al. (1989) for veiling estimate from small spectral bandwidth of a few tens of Angstroms. The calculated veiling value is sensitive to the estimated noise ratio and to spectral mismatches between the object and the reference. We show that an incorrect input noise ratio together with low contrast spectra in noise units can lead to important biasses and we propose solutions to minimize this problem. In case of spectral mismatches and for large contrast spectra compared to the residual of the veiling equation, the relative veiling bias is dominated by the apparent veiling of the reference with respect to the correct underlying object stellar spectrum. The veiling error is found to be proportional to the square of the veiling when the latter becomes larger than unity. If we are limited by the statistical noise, it is little dependent on the spectral resolution. Because of systematic errors, however, it will be difficult to estimate the veiling in a very small bandwidth at spectral resolutions of a few hundreds.},

We find significant impact of the star formation episodes on several observables, like the local age-metallicity and [alpha/Fe] vs metallicity relations, as well as the local stellar metallicity distribution or the existence of young [alpha/Fe]-rich stars. Moreover, we show that the recently found "wiggly" behaviour of the disk abundance gradient with age can be interpreted in terms of either star formation or infall episodes.},

  abstract = {We present a new chemical evolution model for the Galaxy that assumes two main infall episodes, for the formation of the halo-thick disk and thin disk, respectively. We do not try to take into account explicitly the evolution of the halo since our model is better suited for computing the evolution of the disk (thick plus thin), but we implicitly assume that the timescale for the formation of the halo was of the same order as the timescale for the formation of the thick disk. The formation of the thin disk is much longer than that of the thick disk, implying that the infalling gas forming the thin disk comes not only from the thick disk but mainly from the intergalactic medium. The timescale for the formation of the thin disk is assumed to be a function of Galactocentric distance, leading to an inside-out picture for the Galaxy's building. The model takes into account the most up-to-date nucleosynthesis prescriptions and adopts a threshold in the star formation process, which naturally produces a hiatus in the star formation rate at the end of the thick-disk phase, as suggested by recent observations. The model results are compared with an extended set of observational constraints both for the solar neighborhood and for the whole disk. Among these constraints, the tightest is the metallicity distribution of the G-dwarf stars, for which new data are now available. Our model fits these new data very well. The model also predicts the evolution of the gas mass, the star formation rate, the supernova rates, and the abundances of 16 chemical elements as functions of time and Galactocentric distance. We show that, in order to reproduce most of these constraints, a timescale of {$\leq$}1 Gyr for the (halo) thick disk and of 8 Gyr for the thin disk's formation in the solar vicinity are required. We predict that the radial abundance gradients in the inner regions of the disk (R {$<$} 1 R{$\Sun$}) are steeper than in the outer regions, a result confirmed by recent abundance determinations, and that the inner gradients steepen during the Galactic lifetime. The importance and the advantages of assuming a threshold gas density for the onset of the star formation process are discussed.},

We tested three hypotheses to explain the spectrum: atmospheric emission from the planet with either (1) a single value of extinction, (2) a variable extinction, and (3) a combined atmospheric and CPD model. Goodness-of-fit indicators favor the third option, suggesting that circumplanetary material contributes excess thermal emission---most prominent at {$\lambda$}2.3 {$\mu$}m. Inferred accretion rates ({$\sim$}10-7.8--10-7.3 MJ yr-1) are compatible with observational constraints based on the H{$\alpha$} and Br{$\gamma$} lines. For the planet, we derive an effective temperature of 1500--1600 K, surface gravity log(g) {\textasciitilde} 4.0, radius {$\sim$}1.6RJ, mass {$\sim$}10MJ, and possible thick clouds. Models with variable extinction lead to slightly worse fits. However, the amplitude ({$\Delta$}AV3 mag) and timescale of variation (years) required for the extinction would also suggest circumplanetary material.},

They classified known variable stars with an accuracy of 89\% for pulsating variables, 81\% for eclipsing binaries, and 49\% for rotational variables. We examine user performance, agreement between users, and compare the citizen science classifications with our machine learning classifier updated for the \$g\$-band light curves. In general, user activity correlates with higher classification accuracy and higher user agreement. We used the user's "Junk" classifications to develop an effective machine learning classifier to separate real from false variables, and there is a clear path for using this "Junk" training set to significantly improve our primary machine learning classifier. We also illustrate the value of Citizen ASAS-SN for identifying unusual variables with several examples.},

The Pervasive Overview of "Kompanions" of Every M dwarf in Our Neighborhood (POKEMON) speckle survey of nearby M dwarfs is volume limited from M0V through M9V out to 15 pc, with additional targets at larger distances. In total, 1125 stars were observed, and 455 of these are within the volume-limited, 15 pc sample of M-dwarf primaries. When we combine the speckle observations with known companions from the literature, we find that the stellar multiplicity rate of M dwarfs within 15 pc is 23.5\% {\textpm} 2.0\%, and that the companion rate is 28.8\% {\textpm} 2.1\%. We also find that the projected separation distribution for multiples that are known to host planets peaks at 198 au, while the distribution for multiples that are not yet known to host planets peaks at 5.57 au. This result suggests that the presence of close-in stellar companions inhibits the formation of M-dwarf planetary systems, similar to what has been found for FGK stars.},

  abstract = {Gaia DR3 provided a first release of RP spectra and astrophysical parameters for ultracool dwarfs (UCDs). We used these Gaia RP spectra and astrophysical parameters to select the most outlying UCDs. These objects have spectral types of M7 or later and might be young brown dwarfs or low-metallicity objects. This work aimed to find UCDs that have Gaia RP spectra significantly different to the typical population. However, the intrinsic faintness of these UCDs in Gaia means that their spectra were typically rather low signal-to-noise ratio in Gaia DR3. This study is intended as a proof of concept for future iterations of the Gaia data releases. Based on well-studied subdwarfs and young objects, we created a spectral type-specific color ratio, defined using Gaia RP spectra; this ratio is then used to determine which objects are outliers. We then used the objects kinematics and photometry external to Gaia to cut down the list of outliers into a list of `prime candidates'. We produce a list of 58 Gaia RP spectra outliers, seven of which we deem as prime candidates. Of these, six are likely subdwarfs and one is a known young stellar object. Four of six subdwarf candidates were known as subdwarfs already. The two other subdwarf candidates, namely 2MASS J03405673~+~2633447 (sdM8.5) and 2MASS J01204397~+~6623543 (sdM9), are new classifications.},

  abstract = {We present the first isotopic abundances of both \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CO and C\${\textasciicircum}\{18\}\$O in solar twin stars and test the results against several galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models with different nucleosynthesis prescriptions. First, we compare M-band spectra from IRTF/iSHELL to synthetic spectra generated from custom solar atmosphere models using the PHOENIX atmosphere code. Next, we compare our calculated abundances to GCE models that consider isotopic yields from massive stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and fast-rotating stars. The \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$C/\${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$C ratios determined for this sample of solar twins are consistent with predictions from the selected GCE models; however, the \${\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$O/\${\textasciicircum}\{18\}\$O ratios tentatively contradict these predictions. This project constitutes the first in a stellar chemical abundance series seeking to: (1) support the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as it characterizes exoplanet atmospheres, interiors, and biosignatures by providing host star abundances (2) identify how unexplored stellar abundances reveal the process of galactic chemical evolution and correlate with star formation, interior, age, metallicity, and activity; and (3) provide improved stellar ages using stellar abundance measurements. By measuring elemental and isotopic abundances in a variety of stars, we not only supply refined host star parameters, but also provide the necessary foundations for complementary exoplanet characterization studies and ultimately contribute to the exploration of galactic, stellar, and planetary origins and evolution.},

  abstract = {Context. High-resolution spectroscopy has the potential to drive a better understanding of the atmospheric composition, physics, and dynamics of young exoplanets and brown dwarfs, bringing clear insights into the formation channel of individual objects. Aims: Using the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC; R << 35 000), we aim to characterize a young brown dwarf HD 984 B. By measuring its C/O and 12CO/13CO ratios, we expect to gain new knowledge about its origin by confirming the difference in the formation pathways between brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters. Methods: We analysed the KPIC high-resolution spectrum (2.29-2.49 {$\mu$}m) of HD 984 B using an atmospheric retrieval framework based on nested sampling and petitRADTRANS, using both clear and cloudy models. Results: Using our best-fit model, we find C/O = 0.50 {\textpm} 0.01 (0.01 is the statistical error) for HD 984 B which agrees with that of its host star within 1{$\sigma$} (0.40 {\textpm} 0.20). We also retrieve an isotopolog 12CO/13CO ratio of 98-25+20 in its atmosphere, which is similar to that of the Sun. In addition, HD 984 B has a substellar metallicity with [Fe/H] =-0.62-0.02+0.02. Finally, we find that most of the retrieved parameters are independent of our choice of retrieval model. Conclusions: From our measured C/O and 12CO/13CO, the favored formation mechanism of HD 984 B seems to be via gravitational collapse or disk instability and not core accretion, which is a favored formation mechanism for giant exoplanets with m {$<$} 13 MJup and semimajor axis between 10 and 100 au. However, with only a few brown dwarfs with a measured 12CO/13CO ratio, similar analyses using high-resolution spectroscopy will become essential in order to determine planet formation processes more precisely.},

  abstract = {The presence of short-lived ({$\sim$}Myr) radioactive isotopes in meteoritic inclusions at the time of their formation represents a unique opportunity to study the circumstances that led to the formation of the solar system. To interpret these observations, we need to calculate the evolution of radioactive-to-stable isotopic ratios in the Galaxy. We present an extension of the open-source galactic chemical evolution codes NuPyCEE and JINAPyCEE that enable the decay of radioactive isotopes in the interstellar medium to be tracked. We show how the evolution of the isotopic ratio depends on the star formation history and efficiency, star-to-gas mass ratio, and galactic outflows. Given the uncertainties in the observations used to calibrate our model, our predictions for isotopic ratios at the time of formation of the Sun are uncertain by a factor of 3.6. At that time, to recover the actual radioactive-to-stable isotopic ratios predicted by our model, one can multiply the steady-state solution (see Equation ()) by . However, in the cases where the radioactive isotope has a half-life longer than {$\sim$}200 Myr, or the target radioactive or stable isotopes have mass- and/or metallicity-dependent production rates, or they originate from different sources with different delay-time distributions, or the reference isotope is radioactive, our codes should be used for more accurate solutions. Our preliminary calculations confirm the dichotomy between radioactive nuclei in the early solar system with r- and s-process origin, and that 55Mn and 60Fe can be explained by galactic chemical evolution, while 26Al cannot.},

  abstract = {Combining a time-dependent astrochemical model with a model of planet formation and migration, we compute the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) of a range of planetary embryos starting their formation in the inner solar system (1-3 AU). Most of the embryos result in hot Jupiters (M {$\geq$} MJ, orbital radius {$<$}0.1 AU) while the others result in super-Earths at wider orbital radii. The volatile and ice abundance of relevant carbon and oxygen bearing molecular species are determined through a complex chemical kinetic code that includes both gas and grain surface chemistry. This is combined with a model for the abundance of the refractory dust grains to compute the total carbon and oxygen abundance in the protoplanetary disk available for incorporation into a planetary atmosphere. We include the effects of the refractory carbon depletion that has been observed in our solar system, and posit two models that would put this missing carbon back into the gas phase. This excess gaseous carbon then becomes important in determining the final planetary C/O because the gas disk now becomes more carbon rich relative to oxygen (high gaseous C/O). One model, where the carbon excess is maintained throughout the lifetime of the disk results in hot Jupiters that have super-stellar C/O. The other model deposits the excess carbon early in the disk life and allows it to advect with the bulk gas. In this model the excess carbon disappears into the host star within 0.8 Myr, returning the gas disk to its original (substellar) C/O, so the hot Jupiters all exclusively have substellar C/O. This shows that while the solids tend to be oxygen rich, hot Jupiters can have super-stellar C/O if a carbon excess can be maintained by some chemical processing of the dust grains. The atmospheric C/O of the super-Earths at larger radii are determined by the chemical interactions between the gas and ice phases of volatile species rather than the refractory carbon model. Whether the carbon and oxygen content of the atmosphere was accreted primarily by gas or solid accretion is heavily dependent on the mass of the atmosphere and where in the disk the growing planet accreted.},

Based on the parameters used in a pre-computed population of growing planets, their combination allows us to trace the molecular abundances of the gas that is being collected into planetary atmospheres. We include atmospheric pollution of incoming (icy) planetesimals as well as the effect of refractory carbon erosion noted to exist in our own solar system. We find that the carbon and oxygen content of Neptune-mass planets are determined primarily through solid accretion and result in more oxygen-rich (by roughly two orders of magnitude) atmospheres than hot Jupiters, whose C/O are primarily determined by gas accretion. Generally we find a ``main sequence'' between the fraction of planetary mass accreted through solid accretion and the resulting atmospheric C/O; planets of higher solid accretion fraction have lower C/O. Hot Jupiters whose atmospheres have been chemically characterized agree well with our population of planets, and our results suggest that hot-Jupiter formation typically begins near the water ice line. Lower mass hot Neptunes are observed to be much more carbon rich (with 0.33 {$\lessequivlnt$} C/O {$\lessequivlnt$} 1) than is found in our models (C/O {\textasciitilde} 10\textsuperscript{-2{$<$}sup/{$>$}), and suggest that some form of chemical processing may affect their observed C/O over the few billion years between formation and observation. Our population reproduces the general mass-metallicity trend of the solar system and qualitatively reproduces the C/O metallicity anti-correlation that has been inferred for the population of characterized exoplanetary atmospheres.}},

Our analysis relies on high-resolution median spectra built from several tens of spectra recorded between 2019 and 2022, and on synthetic spectra computed with the ZeeTurbo code for various combination of atmospheric parameters and magnetic field strengths. We pursue the efforts undertaken in a previous study and focus on 44 weakly to moderately active M dwarfs. We derive average magnetic field strengths () ranging from 0.05 to 1.15 kG, in good agreement with activity estimates and rotation periods. We found that including magnetic fields in our models has virtually no impact on our derived atmospheric parameters, and that a priori assumptions on the stellar surface gravity can affect our estimated . Our results suggest that small-scale magnetic fields account for more than 70 per cent of the overall average magnetic field for most targets whose large-scale fields were previously measured. We derived low magnetic fluxes for several targets in our sample, and found no clear evidence that decreases with increasing Rossby number in the unsaturated dynamo regime. We even identified counterexamples (GJ 1289 and GJ 1286) where the small-scale field is unusually strong despite the long rotation period. Along with similar results on the large-scale fields, our findings further suggest that dynamo processes may operate in a non-conventional mode in these strongly magnetic, slowly rotating stars.},

  abstract = {The newfound ability to detect SO2 in exoplanet atmospheres presents an opportunity to measure sulfur abundances and so directly test between competing modes of planet formation. In contrast to carbon and oxygen, whose dominant molecules are frequently observed, sulfur is much less volatile and resides almost exclusively in solid form in protoplanetary disks. This dichotomy leads different models of planet formation to predict different compositions of gas giant planets. Whereas planetesimal-based models predict roughly stellar C/S and O/S ratios, pebble-accretion models more often predict superstellar ratios. To explore the detectability of SO2 in transmission spectra and its ability to diagnose planet formation, we present a grid of atmospheric photochemical models and corresponding synthetic spectra for WASP-39b (where SO2 has been detected). Our 3D grid contains 113 models (spanning 1--100{\texttimes} the solar abundance ratio of C, O, and S) for thermal profiles corresponding to the morning and evening terminators, as well as mean terminator transmission spectra. Our models show that for a WASP-39b-like O/H and C/H enhancement of {$\sim$}10{\texttimes} solar, SO2 can only be seen for C/S and O/S  1.5{\texttimes} solar, and that WASP39b's reported SO2 abundance of 1--10 ppm may be more consistent with planetesimal accretion than with pebbleaccretion models (although some pebble models also manage to predict similarly low ratios). More extreme C/S and O/S ratios may be detectable in higher-metallicity atmospheres, suggesting that smaller and more metal-rich gas and ice giants may be particularly interesting targets for testing planet formation models. Future studies should explore the dependence of SO2 on a wider array of planetary and stellar parameters, both for the prototypical SO2 planet WASP-39b, as well as for other hot Jupiters and smaller gas giants.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of 23 L dwarfs whose optical spectra display unusual features. Twenty-one were uncovered during our search for nearby, late-type objects using the Two Micron All-Sky Survey while two were identified in the literature. The unusual spectral features, notably weak FeH molecular absorption and weak Na I and K I doublets, are attributable to low-gravity and indicate that these L dwarfs are young, low-mass brown dwarfs. We use these data to expand the spectral classification scheme for L0 to L5-type dwarfs to include three gravity classes. Most of the low-gravity L dwarfs have southerly declinations and distance estimates within 60 pc. Their implied youth, on-sky distribution, and distances suggest that they are members of nearby, intermediate-age ({\textasciitilde}10-100 Myr), loose associations such as the Beta Pictoris moving group, the Tucana/Horologium association, and the AB Doradus moving group. At an age of 30 Myr and with effective temperatures from 1500 to 2400 K, evolutionary models predict masses of 11-30 M\_Jupiter for these objects. One object, 2M 0355+11, with J-K\_s=2.52+/-0.03, is the reddest L dwarf found in the field and its late spectral type and spectral features indicative of a very low gravity suggest it might also be the lowest-mass field L dwarf. However, before ages and masses can be confidently adopted for any of these low-gravity L dwarfs, additional kinematic observations are needed to confirm cluster membership.},

  abstract = {GQ Lup B is a forming brown dwarf companion (\$M{\textbackslash}sim10-30{\textasciitilde}M\_J\$) showing evidence for an infrared excess associated with a disk surronding the companion itself. Here we present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of GQ Lup B with the Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) on JWST, spanning \$4.8-11.7{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu\$m. We remove the stellar contamination using reference differential imaging based on principal component analysis (PCA), demonstrating that the MRS can perform high-contrast science. Our observations provide a sensitive probe of the disk surrounding GQ Lup B. We find no sign of a silicate feature, similar to other disk surrounding very low mass objects, which likely implies significant grain growth (\$a\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{min\}\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim5{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu\$m), and potentially dust settling. Additionally, we find that if the emission is dominated by an inner wall, the disk around the companion might have an inner cavity larger than the one set by sublimation. Conversely, if our data probe the emission from a thin flat disk, we find the disk to be very compact. More observations are required to confirm this finding and assess the vertical structure of the disk. This approach paves the path to the future study of circumplanetary disks and their physical properties. Our results demonstrate that MIR spectroscopic observations can reveal the physical characteristics of disks around forming companions, providing unique insights into the formation of giant planets, brown dwarfs and their satellites.},

Each data set reveals a faint companion---ROXs 42Bb---located {$\sim$}1.{${''}$}16 (rproj {$\approx$} 150 AU) from the primaries at a position angle consistent with a point source identified earlier by Ratzka et al.. ROXs 42Bb's astrometry is inconsistent with a background star but consistent with a bound companion, possibly one with detected orbital motion. The most recent data set reveals a second candidate companion at {$\sim$}0.{${''}$}5 of roughly equal brightness, though preliminary analysis indicates it is a background object. ROXs 42Bb's H and Ks band photometry is similar to dusty/cloudy young, low-mass late M/early L dwarfs. K band VLT/SINFONI spectroscopy shows ROXs 42Bb to be a cool substellar object (M8--L0; Teff {$\approx$} 1800--2600 K), not a background dwarf star, with a spectral shape indicative of young, low surface gravity planet-mass companions. We estimate ROXs 42Bb's mass to be 6--15 MJ, either below the deuterium-burning limit and thus planet mass or straddling the deuterium-burning limit nominally separating planet-mass companions from other substellar objects. Given ROXs 42b's projected separation and mass with respect to the primaries, it may represent the lowest mass objects formed like binary stars or a class of planet-mass objects formed by protostellar disk fragmentation/disk instability, the latter slightly blurring the distinction between non-deuterium-burning planets like HR 8799 bcde and low-mass, deuterium-burning brown dwarfs.},

These new data nearly double the number of L and T dwarfs that have reported L-band spectra. The near-infrared spectra are combined with previously published red-optical spectra to extend the wavelength coverage to \$0.6  m. Prominent atomic and molecular absorption features are identified including neutral lines of Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, Ti, Na, and K and 19 new weak CH4 absorption features in the H-band spectra of mid- to late-type T dwarfs. In addition, we detect for the first time the 0--0 band of the A 4{\AA}--X 4{\AE}{\`A} transition of VO at \$1.06  m in the spectra of L dwarfs and the P- and R-branches of the  3 band of CH4 in the spectrum of a T dwarf.

Our ALMA mosaic, which covers an extent of {$\sim$}0.7~pc at sub-arcsecond ({$\sim$}1400 au) resolution, reveals a rich population of 16 new millimetre continuum sources surrounding the three previously known millimetre cores. Most of the new sources are located in the outer reaches of the accretion reservoir: the median projected separation from the central, massive (proto)star MM1 is {$\sim$}0.17~pc. The derived physical properties of the new millimetre continuum sources are consistent with those of low-mass prestellar and protostellar cores in nearby star-forming regions: the median mass, radius and density of the new sources are 1.3~M{$\odot$}, 1600 au and n\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm H\_2\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$~cm-3.

  abstract = {Methods. A suite of 3D simulations incorporating both time series and convergence studies were conducted using a high-performance numerical hydrodynamic code. We used, as a simplified and idealised test case, a sample region of the secondary atmosphere of a hot rocky exoplanet, of the order of the scale height of the system, within which the chemical transition CO + O {$\leftrightarrow$} CO2 could occur. Newtonian cooling was employed to force an equilibrium temperature, and a chemical source term was used to maintain a negative mean-molecular-weight gradient in the vertical direction. Results. Our results demonstrate that a mean-molecular-weight gradient and a chemical source term can reduce the atmosphere temperature gradient, a result that does not converge away with resolution and is stable when exploring long timescales. Simulations in two dimensions are prone to the development of shear modes, as already seen in the literature for double-diffusive convection. The 3D convective steady state is not impacted by these shear modes, suggesting that this phenomenon is linked to the dimensionality of the problem. We also show that the presence of the reduced temperature gradient is a function of the forcing timescales, disappearing if the chemical forcing is too slow. We find that the above transition leads to a bifurcation of the atmosphere's temperature profile when the chemical forcing is fast. Such a bifurcation is reminiscent of the bifurcation seen in the boiling crisis for steam or liquid convection. Conclusions. With the reduced temperature gradient in these idealised setups, there exists the possibility of an analogy of the reddening (currently observed in the spectra of brown dwarfs) in the spectra of rocky exoplanet atmospheres. This possibility needs, however, to be checked with detailed 1D models in order to precisely characterise the equilibrium thermal and compositional gradients, the thermal and compositional forcing timescales, and the impact of a realistic equation of state to, in turn, assess if the regime identified here will develop in realistic situations. However, the possibility of this reddening cannot be excluded a priori. This prediction is new for terrestrial atmospheres and represents strong motivation for the use of diabatic models when analysing the atmospheric spectra of rocky exoplanets that will be observed with, for example, the James Webb Space Telescope.},

Space missions such as Wide-Field InfraRed Survey Telescope, Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission, and Large Ultra-Violet/Optical/InfraRed Surveyor will measure reflected light spectra of cold gaseous and rocky planets. To interpret these observations, we introduce EXORELR (Exoplanetary Reflected Light Retrieval), a novel Bayesian retrieval framework to retrieve cloud properties and atmospheric structures from exoplanetary reflected light spectra. As a unique feature, it assumes a vertically nonuniform volume mixing ratio (VMR) profile of water and ammonia, and uses it to construct cloud densities. In this way, clouds and molecular mixture ratios are consistent. We apply EXORELR on three test cases: two exoplanets ({$\upsilon$} And e and 47 Uma b) and Jupiter. We show that we are able to retrieve the concentration of methane in the atmosphere, and estimate the position of clouds when the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is higher than 15, in line with previous works. Moreover, we described the ability of our model to give a chemical identity to clouds, and we discussed whether or not we can observe this difference in the planetary reflection spectrum. Finally, we demonstrate how it could be possible to retrieve molecular concentrations (water and ammonia in this work) below the clouds by linking the nonuniform VMR profile to the cloud presence. This will help to constrain the concentration of water and ammonia unseen in direct measurements.},

For this sample of 58 stars, we provide VJ, RKC, and IKC photometry, new low-dispersion optical (6000--9000 {\AA}) spectra from which uniform spectral types are determined, multi-epoch H{$\alpha$} equivalent widths, and gravity-sensitive Na i indices. For 12 of these 58 stars, strict limits are placed on the presence of stellar and substellar companions based on a pioneering program described here that utilizes precise infrared radial velocities (RVs) and optical astrometric measurements in an effort to search for Jupiter-mass, brown dwarf, and stellar-mass companions. Our infrared RV precision using CSHELL at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility is {$\sim$}90 m s-1 over timescales from 13 days to 5 yr. With our spectroscopic results the mean companion masses that we rule out of existence are 1.5 MJUP or greater in 10 day orbital periods and 7 MJUP or greater in 100 day orbital periods. We use these spectra to determine rotational velocities and absolute RVs of these 12 stars. Our mean astrometric precision using Research Consortium on Nearby Stars (RECONS; www.recons.org) data from the 0.9 m telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory is {$\sim$}3 mas over baselines ranging from 9 to 13 yr. With our astrometric results the mean companion masses that we rule out of existence are greater than 11.5 MJUP with an orbital period of 4 yr and greater than 7.5 MJUP with an orbital period of 8 yr. Although we do not detect companions around our subsample of 12 stars, we demonstrate that our two techniques probe a regime that is commonly missed in other companion searches of late-type stars.},

We discuss the cause of these variations, considering both changes in the physical state of the gas and chemical changes that lead to abundance variations. We used the observed correlations with C18O to suggest that abundance variations are unlikely to be causing the systematic trend observed with {$\Sigma$}SFR, and thus that the mean gas temperature and/or velocity dispersion are systematically higher in higher SFR surface density regions. We present the best-fitting relations between {$\Sigma$}SFR and the 12CO/13CO and 12CO/C18O ratios, and discuss how this effect can help us predict CO isotope emission from galaxies across the known Universe.},

Three classes of hot Jupiter creation hypotheses have been proposed: in situ formation, disk migration, and high-eccentricity tidal migration.

We continue to see the shadow moving in a counterclockwise fashion, but in these new images the shadow has evolved into two separate shadows, implying a change in behavior for the occulting structure. Based on radiative-transfer models of optically thick disk structures casting shadows, we infer that a plausible explanation for the change is that there are now two misaligned components of the inner disk. The first of these disks is located between 5 and 6 au with an inclination of 5.5{$^\circ$} and position angle (PA) of 170{$^\circ$}, and the second between 6 and 7 au with an inclination of 7{$^\circ$} and PA of 50{$^\circ$}.

  abstract = {Methods. We used J-band observations at R = 1800--2360, obtained with VLT/SINFONI in 2017, to record time-series investigations of the hours-to-weeks variability of the H I Paschen {$\beta$} emission line (1.282 {\textmu}m). Contrary to H{$\alpha$}, it should be less affected by chromospheric activity contamination. The photospheric emission was analyzed at each epoch and removed with the FORMOSA forward-modeling tool, using new grids of ATMO models exploring different C/O and [M/H] values. The time series of line profiles and intensities were compared to those of more massive accretors and to predictions from the latest magnetospheric accretion and shock models. To complement these results, we also re-investigated archival spectroscopic observations at near-infrared wavelengths of each target to increase the time frame up to a decade and to build a more comprehensive understanding of the variability processes at play. Results. For GQ Lup b, we find line variability on timescales of several months to decades, whereas it is within the acceptable noise levels on shorter timescales. For GSC 06214-00210 b, we find line variability on timescales of tens of minutes all the way up to a decade. The line profiles of GSC 06214-00210 b are partially resolved in at least one epoch. Both objects show H I Paschen {$\beta$} flux variability that is moderate ({$<$}50\%), on timescales that are below their rotation period, and that is more significant on longer timescales (up to {$\sim$}1000\% on decade-long timescales). This behavior resembles that of classical T Tauri stars. The line profiles of GQ Lup b are blue-shifted and can only be reproduced by magnetospheric accretion models, while those of GSC 06214-00210 b are fairly well reproduced by both magnetospheric accretion and shock models, except for one epoch for which the shock model is highly favored. The companions have C/O values broadly consistent with solar values. Conclusions. While magnetospheric accretion is favored for GQ Lup b, higher resolution (R {$>$} 10 000) observations are required to disentangle the two (non-exclusive) emitting mechanisms. The similar variability behavior observed in these low mass companions and in classical T Tauri stars may support similar accretion mechanisms. The high amplitude of variability on timescales of over a month and longer that is found for both objects could be key to explaining the low yield of H{$\alpha$} imaging campaigns.},

  abstract = {Recent simulations show that giant planets of about 1 MJ migrate inward at a rate that differs from the type II prediction. Here we show that at higher masses, planets migrate outward. Our result differs from previous ones because of our longer simulation times, lower viscosity, and boundary conditions that allow the disk to reach a viscous steady state. We show that, for planets on circular orbits, the transition from inward to outward migration coincides with the known transition from circular to eccentric disks that occurs for planets more massive than a few Jupiters. In an eccentric disk, the torque on the outer disk weakens due to two effects: the planet launches weaker waves, and those waves travel further before damping. As a result, the torque on the inner disk dominates, and the planet pushes itself outward. Our results suggest that the many super-Jupiters observed by direct imaging at large distances from the star may have gotten there by outward migration.},

  abstract = {Methods. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we observed Luhman 16AB at a high spectral resolution in the J-band (1.1--1.4 {\textmu}m) using CRIRES+. To analyse the spectra, we employ an atmospheric retrieval framework, coupling the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS with the MultiNest sampling algorithm. Results. For both objects, we report detections of H2O, K, Na, FeH, and, for the first time in the J-band, hydrogen-fluoride (HF). The K doublet at 1250 nm shows asymmetric absorption in the blue line wings, which we can mostly reproduce via PT -dependent shifts of the line cores. The constrained over-abundance of FeH for Luhman 16B opposes its expected rainout into iron clouds. We resolve this discrepancy by fitting the Luhman 16B spectrum with a two-column model, emulating the patchy surface expected at the L-T transition. We retrieve a cloudy, FeH-depleted column covering {$\sim$} 87\% of the surface and a clear column where deeper, FeHrich layers are exposed. The Luhman 16A spectrum is fit best with a single column where an FeH depletion is constrained in the photosphere. Conclusions. The results suggest an inhomogeneous cloud cover on Luhman 16B, while the primary should have more uniform surface conditions. This is in good agreement with the increased variability observed for the T-type component. Our results also support the cloud-clearing hypothesis as the origin of the FeH re-emergence and J-band brightening.},

  abstract = {It has been proposed that the distinct formation and evolution of exoplanets and brown dwarfs may affect the chemical and isotopic content of their atmospheres. Recent work has indeed shown differences in the \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$C/\${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$C isotope ratio, provisionally attributed to the top-down formation of brown dwarfs and the core accretion pathway of super-Jupiters. The ESO SupJup Survey aims to disentangle the formation pathways of isolated brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions using chemical and isotopic tracers. The survey uses high-resolution spectroscopy with the recently upgraded VLT/CRIRES\${\textasciicircum}+\$ spectrograph, covering a total of 49 targets. Here, we present the first results: an atmospheric characterisation of DENIS J0255-4700, an isolated brown dwarf near the L-T transition. We analyse its K-band spectrum using a retrieval framework where the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS is coupled to PyMultiNest. Gaussian Processes are employed to model inter-pixel correlations and we adopt an updated parameterisation of the PT-profile. Abundances of CO, H\$\_2\$O, CH\$\_4\$, and NH\$\_3\$ are retrieved for this fast-rotating L-dwarf. The ExoMol H\$\_2\$O line list provides a significantly better fit than that of HITEMP. A free-chemistry retrieval is strongly favoured over equilibrium chemistry, caused by an under-abundance of CH\$\_4\$. The free-chemistry retrieval constrains a super-solar C/O-ratio of \${\textbackslash}sim0.68\$ and a solar metallicity. We find tentative evidence (\${\textbackslash}sim3{\textbackslash}sigma\$) for the presence of \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CO, with a constraint on the isotope ratio of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textasciicircum}\{12\}C/{\textasciicircum}\{13\}C\}=184{\textasciicircum}\{+61\}\_\{-40\}\$ and a lower limit of \${\textbackslash}gtrsim97\$, suggesting a depletion of \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$C compared to the interstellar medium (\${\textbackslash}sim68\$). High-resolution, high signal-to-noise K-band spectra provide an excellent means to constrain the chemistry and isotopic content of sub-stellar objects, as is the main objective of the ESO SupJup Survey.},

We used the EVaporating Exoplanets (EVE) code to generate realistic stellar spectra during the transit of exoplanets, accounting for the 3D geometry of the system's architecture and atmospheric transit, as well as for spectral variations over the stellar disc. The absorption spectra were calculated using approaches drawn from the literature and compared to the expected signal. Results. The POLDs from stellar rotation are dominant for moderate to fast rotating stars, reaching amplitudes comparable to atmospheric signals, but they can be mitigated by shifting the stellar line proxies to the radial velocity of the planet-occulted region. Centre-to-limb variations become dominant for slow rotators and are more easily mitigated at the stellar limb. We re-interpret the ESPRESSO data of two iconic systems and confirm that the sodium signature from HD 209458 b mainly arises from POLDs. However, we unveil a possible contribution from the planetary atmosphere that warrants further observations. For MASCARA-1 b, we did not find evidence for atmospheric sodium absorption and we can fully explain the observed signature by a POLD for super-solar stellar sodium abundance. Conclusions. We studied POLDs dependency on star and planet properties, and on the proxy used for planet-occulted lines. Distinguishing planetary absorption signatures from POLDs is challenging without access to accurate estimates of the local stellar spectrum and system orbital parameters. We propose a way to mitigate POLDs and improve atmospheric characterisation, by using simultaneous forward modelling of both the star and the planet to simulate the global observed signatures.},

  abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 observations at 14-20 au spatial resolution of the disk and CO(2-1) outflow around the Class I protostar DG Tau B in Taurus. The disk is very large, both in dust continuum (Reff,95\% = 174 au) and CO (RCO = 700 au). It shows Keplerian rotation around a 1.1 {\textpm} 0.2 M central star and two dust emission bumps at r = 62 and 135 au. These results confirm that large structured disks can form at an early stage where residual infall is still ongoing. The redshifted CO outflow at high velocity shows a striking hollow cone morphology out to 3000 au with a shear-like velocity structure within the cone walls. These walls coincide with the scattered light cavity, and they appear to be rooted within {$<$}60 au in the disk. We confirm their global average rotation in the same sense as the disk, with a specific angular momentum 65 au km s-1. The mass-flux rate of 1.7-2.9 {\texttimes} 10-7 M yr-1 is 35 {\textpm} 10 times that in the atomic jet. We also detect a wider and slower outflow component surrounding this inner conical flow, which also rotates in the same direction as the disk. Our ALMA observations therefore demonstrate that the inner cone walls, and the associated scattered light cavity, do not trace the interface with infalling material, which is shown to be confined to much wider angles ({$>$}70{\textopenbullet}). The properties of the conical walls are suggestive of the interaction between an episodic inner jet or wind with an outer disk wind, or of a massive disk wind originating from 2 to 5 au. However, further modeling is required to establish their origin. In either case, such massive outflow may significantly affect the disk structure and evolution.},

  abstract = {Earth-sized exoplanets that transit nearby, late-spectral-type red dwarfs will be prime targets for atmospheric characterization in the coming decade. Such systems, however, are difficult to find via widefield transit surveys like Kepler or TESS. Consequently, the presence of such transiting planets is unexplored and the occurrence rates of short-period Earth-sized planets around late-M dwarfs remain poorly constrained. Here, we present the deepest photometric monitoring campaign of 22 nearby late-M dwarf stars, using data from over 500 nights on seven 1--2 m class telescopes. Our survey includes all known single quiescent northern late-M dwarfs within 15 pc. We use transit injection-and-recovery tests to quantify the completeness of our survey, successfully identify most ({$>$}80\%) transiting short-period (0.5--1 days) super-Earths (R {$>$}1.9 R {$\oplus$}), and are sensitive ({$\sim$}50\%) to transiting Earth-sized planets (1.0--1.2 R {$\oplus$}). Our high sensitivity to transits with a near-zero false-positive rate demonstrates an efficient survey strategy. Our survey does not yield a transiting planet detection, yet it provides the most sensitive upper limits on transiting planets orbiting our target stars. Finally, we explore multiple hypotheses about the occurrence rates of short-period planets (from Earth-sized planets to giant planets) around late-M dwarfs. We show, for example, that giant planets with short periods ({$<$}1 day) are uncommon around our target stars. Our data set provides some insight into the occurrence rates of short-period planets around TRAPPIST-1-like stars, and our results can help test planetary formation and system evolution models, as well as guide future observations of nearby late-M dwarfs.},

MultiNest is one of the most popular nested sampling implementations, and has been applied to a wide variety of problems in the physical sciences. However, MultiNest results are frequently unreliable, and accompanying convergence tests are a necessary component of any analysis. Using simple, analytically tractable test problems, I illustrate how MultiNest (1) can produce systematically biased estimates of the Bayesian evidence, which are more significantly biased for problems of higher dimensionality; (2) can derive posterior estimates with errors on the order of \${\textbackslash}sim100{\textbackslash}\%\$; (3) is more likely to underestimate the width of a credible interval than to overestimate it - to a minor degree for smooth problems, but much more so when sampling noisy likelihoods. Nevertheless, I show how MultiNest can be used to jump-start Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling or more rigorous nested sampling techniques, potentially accelerating more trustworthy measurements of posterior distributions and Bayesian evidences, and overcoming the challenge of Markov chain Monte Carlo initialization.},

  abstract = {The problem on heating the atmospheres of T Tauri stars by radiation from an accretion shock has been solved. The structure and radiation spectrum of the emerging so-called hot spot have been calculated in the LTE approximation. The emission not only in continuum but also in lines has been taken into account for the first time when calculating the spot spectrum. Comparison with observations has shown that the strongest of these lines manifest themselves as narrow components of helium and metal emission lines, while the weaker ones decrease significantly the depth of photospheric absorption lines, although until now, this effect has been thought to be due to the emission continuum alone. The veiling by lines changes the depth of different photospheric lines to a very different degree even within a narrow spectral range. Therefore, the nonmonotonic wavelength dependence of the degree of veiling r found for some CTTS does not suggest a nontrivial spectral energy distribution of the veiling continuum. In general, it makes sense to specify the degree of veiling r only by providing the set of photospheric lines from which this quantity was determined. We show that taking into account the contribution of lines to the veiling of the photospheric spectrum can cause the existing estimates of the accretion rate onto T Tauri stars to decrease by several times, with this being also true for stars with a comparatively weakly veiled spectrum. Neglecting the contribution of lines to the veiling can also lead to appreciable errors in determining the effective temperature, interstellar extinction, radial velocity, and v sin i.},

  abstract = {The recent discoveries of massive planets on ultra-wide orbits of HR 8799 and Fomalhaut present a new challenge for planet formation theorists. Our goal is to figure out which of three giant planet formation mechanisms---core accretion (with or without migration), scattering from the inner disk, or gravitational instability---could be responsible for Fomalhaut b, HR 8799 b, c and d, and similar planets discovered in the future. This paper presents the results of numerical experiments comparing the long-period planet formation efficiency of each possible mechanism in model A star, G star, and M star disks. First, a simple core accretion simulation shows that planet cores forming beyond 35 AU cannot reach critical mass, even under the most favorable conditions one can construct. Second, a set of N-body simulations demonstrates that planet--planet scattering does not create stable, wide-orbit systems such as HR 8799. Finally, a linear stability analysis verifies previous work showing that global spiral instabilities naturally arise in high-mass disks. We conclude that massive gas giants on stable orbits with semimajor axes a {$\greaterequivlnt$} 35 AU form by gravitational instability in the disk. We recommend that observers examine the planet detection rate as a function of stellar age, controlling for the planets' dimming with time. Any age trend would indicate that planets on wide orbits are transient relics of scattering from the inner disk. If planet detection rate is found to be independent of stellar age, it would confirm our prediction that gravitational instability is the dominant mode of producing detectable planets on wide orbits. We also predict that the occurrence ratio of long-period to short-period gas giants should be highest for M dwarfs due to the inefficiency of core accretion and the expected small fragment mass ({$\sim$}10 MJup) in their disks.},

From these observations, we first infer that GQ Lup has a photospheric temperature of 4300 {\textpm} 50\,K and a rotation period of 8.4 {\textpm} 0.3\,d; it implies that it is a 1.05 {\textpm} 0.07\,M{$\odot$} star viewed at an inclination of {$\simeq$}30{$^\circ$}, with an age of 2--5\,Myr and a radius of 1.7 {\textpm} 0.2\,R{$\odot$}, and has just started to develop a radiative core.Large Zeeman signatures are clearly detected at all times, both in photospheric lines and in accretion-powered emission lines, probing longitudinal fields of up to 6\,kG and hence making GQ Lup the cTTS with the strongest large-scale fields known as of today. Rotational modulation of Zeeman signatures, also detected both in photospheric and accretion proxies, is clearly different between our two runs; we take this as further evidence that the large-scale fields of cTTSs are evolving with time and thus that they are produced by non-stationary dynamo processes.Using tomographic imaging, we reconstruct maps of the large-scale field, of the photospheric brightness and of the accretion-powered emission at the surface of GQ Lup at both epochs. We find that the magnetic topology is mostly poloidal and axisymmetric with respect to the rotation axis of the star; moreover, the octupolar component of the large-scale field (of polar strength 2.4 and 1.6\,kG in 2009 and 2011, respectively) dominates the dipolar component (of polar strength {$\simeq$}1\,kG) by a factor of {$\simeq$}2, consistent with the fact that GQ Lup is no longer fully convective.GQ Lup also features dominantly poleward magnetospheric accretion at both epochs. The large-scale dipole component of GQ Lup is however not strong enough to disrupt the surrounding accretion disc further than about half-way to the corotation radius (at which the Keplerian period of the disc material equals the stellar rotation period), suggesting that GQ Lup should rapidly spin up like other similar partly convective cTTSs.We finally report a 0.4\,km\,s-1 radial velocity change for GQ Lup between 2009 and 2011, suggesting that a brown dwarf other than GQ Lup B may be orbiting GQ Lup at a distance of only a few au's.},

With a central position among the newly started programmes, the SPIRou Legacy Survey (SLS) Large Programme was allocated 300 CFHT nights until at least mid 2022. We also briefly describe a few of the first results obtained in the various science topics that SPIRou started investigating, focusing in particular on planetary systems of nearby M dwarfs, transiting exoplanets and their atmospheres, magnetic fields of young stars, but also on alternate science goals like the atmospheres of M dwarfs and the Earth's atmosphere. We finally conclude on the key role that SPIRou and the CFHT can play in coordination with forthcoming major facilities like the JWST, the ELTs, PLATO, and ARIEL over the decade.},

We identified 156 planet candidates, including one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest. We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we find Earth-size planets (1-1.5 R{$\oplus$}) and super-Earths (1.5-2 R{$\oplus$}) per M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of 2.5 {\textpm} 0.2 planets per M dwarf with radii 1-4 R{$\oplus$} and periods shorter than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone (HZ) based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of Earth-size planets and super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. Adopting the broader insolation boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate of Earth-size planets and super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. This suggests that the nearest potentially habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are 2.6 {\textpm} 0.4 pc and pc away, respectively. If we include super-Earths, these distances diminish to 2.1 {\textpm} 0.2 pc and pc.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context. {$<$}i/{$>$}GQ Lup A is a classical T Tauri star that shows clear signs of accretion through the presence of inverse P Cygni profiles in its main emission lines. Recently, Neuh{\"a}user et al. (2005, A\&A, 435, L13) found a co-moving sub-stellar companion of GQ Lup A, raising the importance of determining precise stellar parameters, system age, and distance to GQ Lup.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}Our main objective is to use spectrophotometric time series to determine GQ Lup A stellar parameters and predict its photospheric spectral distribution. The excess spectral luminosity can then be measured and employed to test predictions of magnetospheric accretion models of classical T Tauri stars.\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We present the analysis of 18 spectrophotometric observations of the T Tauri star GQ Lup A (K7) obtained with the Boller \& Chivens spectrograph at the 1.52 m ESO telescope in La Silla. We also revisited archival photometric data of this star, comparing previous light curve variability with our more recent data.\emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}We determined the photospheric flux of GQ Lup A on each observing night and obtained the stellar radius ( = 1.8 \emph{{\textpm}{$<$}i/{$>$} 0.3 ), adopting a mean distance of 150 \emph{{\textpm}{$<$}i/{$>$} 20 pc to the Lupus 1 cloud. Assuming a K7 V temperature of 4060 K, the luminosity of GQ Lup A is = 0.8 \emph{{\textpm}{$<$}i/{$>$} 0.3 . Standard evolutionary models indicate a stellar mass of = 0.8 \emph{{\textpm}{$<$}i/{$>$} 0.2 and an age of 3 \emph{{\textpm}{$<$}i/{$>$} 2 Myr. GQ Lup A spectral lines are consistent with a projected rotational velocity of = 6.5 \emph{{\textpm}{$<$}i/{$>$} 2.0 km s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}. We measured the excess emission -- veiling -- and used the resulting photospheric spectral distribution to calculate a stellar extinction (\emph{A{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{V{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$}) of 0.5 \emph{{\textpm}{$<$}i/{$>$} 0.1. The veiling was found to be variable and periodic at 10.7 \emph{{\textpm}{$<$}i/{$>$} 1.6 days, which is consistent with the period of GQ Lup A obtained from archival \emph{B{$<$}i/{$>$} band photometric data (10.43 \emph{{\textpm}{$<$}i/{$>$} 0.12 days). The star exhibits strong emission lines with substantial variability in flux. The emission line fluxes are strongly correlated with one another but not with veiling.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {VHS~J1256-1257~AB is an ultracool dwarf binary that hosts a wide-separation planetary-mass companion that is a key target of the JWST Exoplanet Early Release Science programme. Using Keck adaptive optics imaging and aperture masking interferometry, we have determined the host binary's orbit (a = 1.96~{\textpm}~0.03\,au, P = 7.31~{\textpm}~0.02\,yr, e = 0.883~{\textpm}~0.003) and measured its dynamical total mass (0.141~{\textpm}~0.008\,M{$\odot$}). This total mass is consistent with VHS~J1256-1257~AB being a brown dwarf binary or pair of very low-mass stars. In addition, we measured the orbital motion of VHS~J1256-1257~b with respect to the barycentre of VHS~J1256-1257~AB, finding that the wide companion's orbit is also eccentric (\$e=0.68{\textasciicircum}\{+0.11\}\_\{-0.10\}\$), with a mutual inclination of 115{$\bigcirc$} {\textpm} 14{$\bigcirc$} with respect to the central binary. This orbital architecture is consistent with VHS~J1256-1257~b attaining a significant mutual inclination through dynamical scattering and thereafter driving Kozai--Lidov cycles to pump the eccentricity of VHS~J1256-1257~AB. We derive a cooling age of 140~{\textpm}~20\,Myr for VHS~J1256-1257~AB from low-mass stellar/substellar evolutionary models. At this age, the luminosity of VHS~J1256-1257~b is consistent with both deuterium-inert and deuterium-fusing evolutionary tracks. We thus find a bimodal probability distribution for the mass of VHS~J1256-1257~b, either 12.0~{\textpm}~0.1\,MJup or 16~{\textpm}~1\,MJup, from these models. Future spectroscopic data to measure isotopologues such as HDO and CH3D could break this degeneracy and provide a strong test of substellar models at the deuterium-fusion mass boundary.},

  abstract = {Context. The atmospheres of extrasolar planets are thought to be built  largely through accretion of pebbles and planetesimals. Such pebbles are also the building blocks of comets. The chemical composition of their volatiles are usually taken to be inherited from the ices in the collapsing cloud. However, chemistry in the protoplanetary disk midplane can modify the composition of ices and gases. Aims: To investigate if and how chemical evolution affects the abundances and distributions of key volatile species in the midplane of a protoplanetary disk in the 0.2-30 AU range. Methods: A disk model used in planet population synthesis models is adopted, providing temperature, density and ionisation rate at different radial distances in the disk midplane. A full chemical network including gas-phase, gas-grain interactions and grain-surface chemistry is used to evolve chemistry in time, for 1 Myr. Both molecular (inheritance from the parent cloud) and atomic (chemical reset) initial conditions are investigated. Results: Great diversity is observed in the relative abundance ratios of the main considered species: H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, O2, NH3 and N2. The choice of ionisation level, the choice of initial abundances, as well as the extent of chemical reaction types included are all factors that affect the chemical evolution. The only exception is the inheritance scenario with a low ionisation level, which results in negligible changes compared with the initial abundances, regardless of whether or not grain-surface chemistry is included. The grain temperature plays an important role, especially in the critical 20-28 K region where atomic H no longer sticks long enough to the surface to react, but atomic O does. Above 28 K, efficient grain-surface production of CO2 ice is seen, as well as O2 gas and ice under certain conditions, at the expense of H2O and CO. H2O ice is produced on grain surfaces only below 28 K. For high ionisation levels at intermediate disk radii, CH4 gas is destroyed and converted into CO and CO2 (in contrast with previous models), and similarly NH3 gas is converted into N2. At large radii around 30 AU, CH4 ice is enhanced leading to a low gaseous CO abundance. As a result, the overall C/O ratios for gas and ice change significantly with radius and with model assumptions. For high ionisation levels, chemical processing becomes significant after a few times 105 yr. Conclusions: Chemistry in the disk midplane needs to be considered in the determination of the volatile composition of planetesimals. In the inner {$<$}30 AU disk, interstellar ice abundances are preserved only if the ionisation level is low, or if these species are included in larger bodies within 105 yr.},

The effect of small perturbations due to slow changes in the cluster potential are important for the evolution of planetary systems. In addition, the probability of a star to lose a planet is independent of the planet mass and independent of its initial orbital separation.

  abstract = {Age is a fundamental stellar property, yet for many stars, it is difficult to reliably determine. For M dwarfs, it has been notoriously so. Due to their lower masses, core hydrogen fusion proceeds at a much slower rate in M dwarfs than it does in more massive stars like the Sun. As a consequence, more customary age determination methods (e.g., isochrones and asteroseismology) are unreliable for M dwarfs. As these methods are unavailable, many have searched for reliable alternatives. The M dwarfs comprise the overwhelming majority of the nearby stellar inventory, which makes the determination of their fundamental parameters even more important. Further, an ever-increasing number of exoplanets are being found to orbit M dwarfs, and recent studies have suggested that they may have a relatively higher number of low-mass planets than other spectral types. Determining the ages of M dwarfs then allows us to better study any hosted exoplanets as well. Fortunately, M dwarfs possess magnetic activity and stellar winds like other cool dwarf stars. This causes them to undergo the spin-down effect (rotating with longer periods) as they age. For this reason, stellar rotation rate has been considered a potentially powerful age determination parameter for over 50 yr. Calibrating reliable age--rotation relationships for M dwarfs has been a lengthy process, but here we present the age--rotation relationships for {$\sim$}M0--6.5 dwarfs, determined as part of the Living with a Red Dwarf program. These relationships should prove invaluable for a wide range of stellar astrophysics and exoplanetary science applications.},

Along with observations, we summarize theoretical models that build our physical understanding of how discs evolve and disperse and discuss their significance in the context of the formation and evolution of planetary systems. By confronting theoretical predictions with observations, we also identify the most promising areas for future progress.},

Here we confirm the detection of CO in the atmosphere of WASP-39b using the NIRSpec G395H data and cross-correlation techniques. We do this by searching for the CO signal in the unbinned transmission spectrum of the planet between 4.6 and 5.0 {$\mu$}m, where the contribution of CO is expected to be higher than that of other anticipated molecules in the planet's atmosphere. Our search results in a detection of CO with a cross-correlation function (CCF) significance of 6.6{$\sigma$} when using a template with only 12C16O lines. The CCF significance of the CO signal increases to 7.5{$\sigma$} when including in the template lines from additional CO isotopologues, with the largest contribution being from 13C16O. Our results highlight how cross-correlation techniques can be a powerful tool for unveiling the chemical composition of exoplanetary atmospheres from medium-resolution transmission spectra, including the detection of isotopologues.},

  abstract = {Catastrophically evaporating rocky planets provide a unique opportunity to study the composition of small planets. The surface composition of these planets can be constrained via modelling their comet-like tails of dust. In this work, we present a new self-consistent model of the dusty tails: we physically model the trajectory of the dust grains after they have left the gaseous outflow, including an on-the-fly calculation of the dust cloud's optical depth. We model two catastrophically evaporating planets: KIC 1255b and K2-22b. For both planets, we find the dust is likely composed of magnesium-iron silicates (olivine and pyroxene), consistent with an Earth-like composition. We constrain the initial dust grain sizes to be \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 1.25-1.75 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m and the average (dusty) planetary mass-loss rate to be \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 3\$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$. Our model shows the origin of the leading tail of dust of K2-22b is likely a combination of the geometry of the outflow and a low radiation pressure force to stellar gravitational force ratio. We find the optical depth of the dust cloud to be a factor of a few in the vicinity of the planet. Our composition constraint supports the recently suggested idea that the dusty outflows of these planets go through a greenhouse effect-nuclear winter cycle, which gives origin to the observed transit depth time variability. Magnesium-iron silicates have the necessary visible-to-infrared opacity ratio to give origin to this cycle in the high mass-loss state.},

We use these data to evaluate photometric, spectral, and kinematic signatures of youth as 2M0355 is the reddest isolated L dwarf yet classified. We confirm its low-gravity spectral morphology and find a strong resemblance to the sharp triangular shaped H-band spectrum of the {\textasciitilde}10 Myr planetary-mass object 2M1207b. We find that 2M0355 is underluminous compared to a normal field L5 dwarf in the optical and Mauna Kea Observatory J, H, and K bands and transitions to being overluminous from 3 to 12 {$\mu$}m, indicating that enhanced photospheric dust shifts flux to longer wavelengths for young, low-gravity objects, creating a red spectral energy distribution. Investigating the near-infrared color-magnitude diagram for brown dwarfs confirms that 2M0355 is redder and underluminous compared to the known brown dwarf population, similar to the peculiarities of directly imaged exoplanets 2M1207b and HR8799bcd.

  abstract = {Beyond our solar system, aurorae have been inferred from radio observations of isolated brown dwarfs (e.g. Hallinan et al. 2006; Kao et al. 2023). Within our solar system, giant planets have auroral emission with signatures across the electromagnetic spectrum including infrared emission of H3+ and methane. Isolated brown dwarfs with auroral signatures in the radio have been searched for corresponding infrared features but have only had null detections (e.g. Gibbs et al. 2022). CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3. (W1935 for short) is an isolated brown dwarf with a temperature of {\textasciitilde}482 K. Here we report JWST observations of strong methane emission from W1935 at 3.326 microns. Atmospheric modeling leads us to conclude that a temperature inversion of {\textasciitilde}300 K centered at 1-10 millibar replicates the feature. This represents an atmospheric temperature inversion for a Jupiter-like atmosphere without irradiation from a host star. A plausible explanation for the strong inversion is heating by auroral processes, although other internal and/or external dynamical processes cannot be ruled out. The best fit model rules out the contribution of H3+ emission which is prominent in solar system gas giants however this is consistent with rapid destruction of H3+ at the higher pressure where the W1935 emission originates (e.g. Helling et al. 2019).},

We also add low- or moderate-resolution near-infrared spectra for 43 sources confirming their low surface gravity features. Among the full sample, we find 39 objects to be high-likelihood or new bona fide members of nearby moving groups, 92 objects to be ambiguous members and 21 objects that are non-members. Using this age-calibrated sample, we investigate trends in gravity classification, photometric color, absolute magnitude, color--magnitude, luminosity, and effective temperature. We find that gravity classification and photometric color clearly separate 5--130 Myr sources from {$>$}3 Gyr field objects, but they do not correlate one to one with the narrower 5--130 Myr age range. Sources with the same spectral subtype in the same group have systematically redder colors, but they are distributed between 1 and 4{$\sigma$} from the field sequences and the most extreme outlier switches between intermediate- and low-gravity sources either confirmed in a group or not. The absolute magnitudes of low-gravity sources from the J band through W3 show a flux redistribution when compared to equivalently typed field brown dwarfs that is correlated with spectral subtype. Low-gravity, late-type L dwarfs are fainter at J than the field sequence but brighter by W3. Low-gravity M dwarfs are {$>$}1 mag brighter than field dwarfs in all bands from J through W3. Clouds, which are a far more dominant opacity source for L dwarfs, are the likely cause. On color--magnitude diagrams, the latest-type, low-gravity L dwarfs drive the elbow of the L/T transition up to 1 mag redder and 1 mag fainter than field dwarfs at MJ but are consistent with or brighter than the elbow at MW1 and MW2. We conclude that low-gravity dwarfs carry an extreme version of the cloud conditions of field objects to lower temperatures, which logically extends into the lowest-mass, directly imaged exoplanets. Furthermore, there is an indication on color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs; such as MJ versus (J--W2)) of increasingly redder sequences separated by gravity classification, although it is not consistent across all CMD combinations. Examining bolometric luminosities for planets and low-gravity objects, we confirm that (in general) young M dwarfs are overluminous while young L dwarfs are normal compared to the field. Using model extracted radii, this translates into normal to slightly warmer M dwarf temperatures compared to the field sequence and lower temperatures for L dwarfs with no obvious correlation with the assigned moving group.},

  abstract = {We present medium-resolution optical ({$\lambda$}/{$\Delta\lambda$} {$\sim$} 4000) and near-infrared ({$\lambda$}/{$\Delta\lambda$} {$\sim$} 8000) spectral data for components of the newly discovered WISE J104915.57-531906.1AB (Luhman 16AB) brown dwarf binary. The optical spectra reveal strong 6708 {\AA} Li i absorption in both Luhman 16A (8.0 {\textpm} 0.4 {\AA}) and Luhman 16B (3.8 {\textpm} 0.4 {\AA}) confirming their substellar mass. Interestingly, this is the first detection of Li i absorption in a T dwarf. In the near-infrared data, we find strong K i absorption at 1.168, 1.177, 1.243, and 1.254 {$\mu$}m in both components. Neither the optical nor the near-infrared alkali lines show low surface gravity signatures. Along with the Li i absorption detection, we can broadly constrain the system age to 0.1--3 Gyr or the mass to 20--65 MJup for each component. Compared to the strength of K i line absorption in equivalent spectral subtype brown dwarfs, Luhman 16A is weaker while Luhman 16B is stronger. Analyzing the spectral region around each doublet in distance scaled flux units and comparing the two sources, we confirm the J-band flux reversal and find that Luhman 16B has a brighter continuum in the 1.17 {$\mu$}m and 1.25 {$\mu$}m regions than Luhman 16A. Converting flux units to a brightness temperature we interpret this to mean that the secondary is {$\sim$}50 K warmer than the primary in regions dominated by condensate grain scattering. One plausible explanation for this difference is that Luhman 16B has thinner clouds or patchy holes in its atmosphere allowing us to see to deeper, hotter regions. We also detect comparably strong FeH in the 0.9896 {$\mu$}m Wing--Ford band for both components. Traditionally, a signpost of changing atmosphere conditions from late-type L to early T, the persistence and similarity of FeH at 0.9896 {$\mu$}m in both Luhman 16A and Luhman 16B is an indication of homogenous atmosphere conditions. We calculate bolometric luminosities from observed data supplemented with best fit models for longer wavelengths and find the components are consistent within 1{$\sigma$} with resultant Teffs of 1310 {\textpm} 30 K and 1280 {\textpm} 75 K for Luhman 16AB respectively.},

  abstract = {This paper presents new high angular resolution ALMA 1.3 mm dust continuum observations of the protoplanetary system AS 209 in the Ophiuchus star forming region. The dust continuum emission is characterized by a main central core and two prominent rings at \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} = 75 au and \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} = 130 au intervaled by two gaps at \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} = 62 au and \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} = 103 au. The two gaps have different widths and depths, with the inner one being narrower and shallower. We determined the surface density of the millimeter dust grains using the 3D radiative transfer disk code DALI. According to our fiducial model the inner gap is partially filled with millimeter grains while the outer gap is largely devoid of dust. The inferred surface density is compared to 3D hydrodynamical simulations (FARGO-3D) of planet-disk interaction. The outer dust gap is consistent with the presence of a giant planet (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{planet{$<$}sub/{$>$} {\textasciitilde} 0.7 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{Saturn{$<$}sub/{$>$}); the planet is responsible for the gap opening and for the pile-up of dust at the outer edge of the planet orbit. The simulations also show that the same planet could be the origin of the inner gap at \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} = 62 au. The relative position of the two dust gaps is close to the 2:1 resonance and we have investigated the possibility of a second planet inside the inner gap. The resulting surface density (including location, width and depth of the two dust gaps) are in agreement with the observations. The properties of the inner gap pose a strong constraint to the mass of the inner planet (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{planet{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 0.1 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{J{$<$}sub/{$>$}). In both scenarios (single or pair of planets), the hydrodynamical simulations suggest a very low disk viscosity (\emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 10\textsuperscript{-4{$<$}sup/{$>$}). Given the young age of the system (0.5--1 Myr), this result implies that the formation of giant planets occurs on a timescale of {$\lessequivlnt$}1 Myr.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

However, these efforts have been hampered by modelling degeneracies between composition and cloud properties that are caused by limited data quality               5--9               . Here we present the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b obtained using the Single-Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode of the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument on the JWST. This spectrum spans 0.6--2.8\,{$\mu$}m in wavelength and shows several water-absorption bands, the potassium resonance doublet and signatures of clouds. The precision and broad wavelength coverage of NIRISS/SOSS allows us to break model degeneracies between cloud properties and the atmospheric composition of WASP-39b, favouring a heavy-element enhancement (`metallicity') of about 10--30 times the solar value, a sub-solar carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and a solar-to-super-solar potassium-to-oxygen (K/O) ratio. The observations are also best explained by wavelength-dependent, non-grey clouds with inhomogeneous coverageof the planet's terminator.},

  abstract = {Space-based high-contrast imaging mission concepts for studying rocky exoplanets in reflected light are currently under community study. We develop an inverse modeling framework to estimate the science return of such missions given different instrument design considerations. By combining an exoplanet albedo model, instrument noise model, and ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, we explore retrievals of atmospheric and planetary properties for Earth twins as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and resolution (R). Our forward model includes Rayleigh-scattering, single-layer water clouds with patchy coverage, and pressure-dependent absorption due to water vapor, oxygen, and ozone. We simulate data at R=70 and 140 from 0.4 to 1.0{$\mu$}m with S/N=5, 10, 15, and 20 at 550nm (i.e., for HabEx/LUVOIR-type instruments). At these same S/Ns, we simulate data for WFIRST paired with a starshade, which includes two photometric points between 0.48 and 0.6{$\mu$}m and R=50 spectroscopy from 0.6 to 0.97{$\mu$}m. Given our noise model for WFIRST-type detectors, we find that weak detections of water vapor, ozone, and oxygen can be achieved with observations with at least R=70/S/N=15 or R=140/S/N=10 for improved detections. Meaningful constraints are only achieved with R=140/S/N=20 data. The WFIRST data offer limited diagnostic information, needing at least S/N=20 to weakly detect gases. Most scenarios place limits on planetary radius but cannot constrain surface gravity and, thus, planetary mass.},

The derivation of the D/H ratio also includes previous measurements of the R(2) line with the Short Wavelength Spectrometer on board the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). The available spectroscopic line information of the three rotational transitions is discussed and applied in the radiative transfer calculations. The best simultaneous fit of all three lines requires only a minor departure from the Spitzer temperature profile of Uranus and a departure limited to 2K from the Voyager temperature profile of Neptune (each time around the tropopause). The resulting and remarkably similar D/H ratios for Uranus and Neptune are found to be (4.4 {\textpm} 0.4) {\texttimes} 10-5 and (4.1 {\textpm} 0.4) {\texttimes} 10-5, respectively. Although the deuterium enrichment in the two atmospheres compared to the protosolar value is confirmed, it is found to be lower compared to previous analyses. Using interior models from the literature and assuming that complete mixing of the atmosphere and interior occured during the planets' history, we derive a D/H in protoplanetary ices between (5.75-7.0) {\texttimes} 10-5 for Uranus and between (5.1-7.7) {\texttimes} 10-5 for Neptune. Conversely, adopting a cometary D/H for the protoplanetary ices between (15-30) {\texttimes} 10-5, we constrain the interior models of the two planets to have an ice mass fraction of 14-32\%, i.e., the two planets are rock-dominated. Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

With nearly simultaneous spectra from 0.48 to 2.4 {$\mu$}m acquired with HIRES and NIRSPEC on Keck and SpeX on the Infrared Telescope Facility, we find significant excess continuum emission throughout this region, including the I, Y, and J bands, which are usually thought to diagnose primarily photospheric emission. The IYJ excess correlates with the excess in the V band, attributed to accretion shocks in the photosphere, and the excess in the K band, attributed to dust in the inner disk near the dust sublimation radius, but it is too large to be an extension of the excess from these sources. The spectrum of the excess emission is broad and featureless, suggestive of blackbody radiation with a temperature between 2200 and 5000 K. The luminosity of the IYJ excess is comparable to the accretion luminosity inferred from modeling the blue and ultraviolet excess emission and may require reassessment of disk accretion rates. The source of the IYJ excess is unclear. In stars of low accretion rate, the size of the emitting region is consistent with cooler material surrounding small hot accretion spots in the photosphere. However, for stars with high accretion rates, the projected area is comparable to or exceeds that of the stellar surface. We suggest that at least some of the IYJ excess emission arises in the dust-free gas inside the dust sublimation radius in the disk.},

  abstract = {The near infrared veiling (the ratio of any non-photospheric excess flux to the photospheric flux) is studied for a sample of 50 mainly Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), mostly from the Taurus-Auriga complex, based on high resolution spectra (\{R\} {\textasciitilde} 20,500) of wavelength regions in the J and K wavebands (near Pa {$\beta$} - 1.28215 mu m - and near Br {$\gamma$} - 2.16611 mu m respectively). The method used to compute the veiling at these wavelengths is independent of any assumptions about reddening/extinction towards the studied objects. Photospheric absorption lines are identified in the spectra of 73\% of the CTTS observed at J and in 71\% at K. For these stars the veiling in the J (rJ) and K (rK) wavebands was determined. Average values for all the stars are {$<$} rJ{$>$} = 0.57 and {$<$} rK{$>$} = 1.29. Considering only stars with veilings determined to better than 3 sigma these means are {$<$} rJ{$>$} = 0.97 and {$<$} rK{$>$} = 1.76. For the remaining 27\% of the stars observed at J and 29\% at K, for which no photospheric lines were identified, lower limits were obtained for rJ and rK. Considering only those stars with lower limits the mean lower limits are {$<$} rJ{$>$} {$>$} 1.34 and {$<$} rK{$>$} {$>$} 2.4. Our results indicate high veiling of these stars in the NIR. The NIR veilings deduced are considerably greater than expected from extrapolation of the veilings measured in the optical, assuming that they result from an accretion shock, and are also bigger than the expected veiling from an accretion disk. Although the origin of this large NIR veiling is not clear one possibility deserving further study is that it partially arises within shocks at the base of magnetospheric accretion columns which cover a large fraction of the stellar surface. The possibility that the near infrared veiling of photospheric lines is not caused by a continuum, but is rather due to non-photospheric line emission from the disk or from a shock at the base of the accretion columns, should also be investigated by detailed modelling including the Ti, Fe, Si \& Mn lines as opacity sources.},

  abstract = {High-resolution infrared spectroscopy plays an important role in astrophysics from the search for exoplanets to cosmology. Yet, many existing infrared spectrographs are limited by a rather small simultaneous wavelength coverage. The AO assisted CRIRES instrument, installed at the ESO VLT on Paranal, is one of the few IR (0.92-5.2 {$\mu$}m) highresolution spectrographs in operation since 2006. However it has a limitation that hampers its efficient use: the wavelength range covered in a single exposure is limited to {\textasciitilde}15 nanometers. The CRIRES Upgrade project (CRIRES+) will transform CRIRES into a cross-dispersed spectrograph and will also add new capabilities. By introducing crossdispersion elements the simultaneously covered wavelength range will be increased by at least a factor of 10 with respect to the present configuration, while the operational wavelength range will be preserved. For advanced wavelength calibration, new custom made absorption gas cells and etalons will be added. A spectro-polarimetric unit will allow one for the first time to record circularly polarized spectra at the highest spectral resolution. This will be all supported by a new data reduction software which will allow the community to take full advantage of the new capabilities of CRIRES+.},

  abstract = {Methods. We computed the formation of planets, considering the oligarchic regime for the growth of the solid core. Embryos growing in the disc stir their neighbour planetesimals, exciting their relative velocities, which makes accretion more difficult. Here we introduce a more realistic treatment for the evolution of planetesimals' relative velocities, which directly impact on the formation timescale. For this, we computed the excitation state of planetesimals, as a result of stirring by forming planets, and gas-solid interactions. Results. We find that the formation of giant planets is favoured by the accretion of small planetesimals, as their random velocities are more easily damped by the gas drag of the nebula. Moreover, the capture radius of a protoplanet with a (tiny) envelope is also larger for small planetesimals. However, planets migrate as a result of disc-planet angular momentum exchange, with important consequences for their survival: due to the slow growth of a protoplanet in the oligarchic regime, rapid inward type I migration has important implications on intermediate-mass planets that have not yet started their runaway accretion phase of gas. Most of these planets are lost in the central star. Surviving planets have masses either below 10 M{$\oplus$} or above several Jupiter masses. Conclusions. To form giant planets before the dissipation of the disc, small planetesimals ({$\sim$}0.1 km) have to be the major contributors of the solid accretion process. However, the combination of oligarchic growth and fast inward migration leads to the absence of intermediate-mass planets. Other processes must therefore be at work to explain the population of extrasolar planets that are presently known.},

Two published catalogs find C/O {$>$} 0.8 in 25\%--30\% of systems, and C/O {$>$} 1.0 in {$\sim$}6\%--10\%. It has been suggested that in protoplanetary disks with C/O {$>$} 0.8 that the condensation pathways to refractory solids will differ from what occurred in our solar system, where C/O = 0.55. The carbonrich disks are calculated to make carbon-dominated rocky planets, rather than oxygen-dominated ones. Here we suggest that the derived stellar C/O ratios are overestimated. One constraint on the frequency of high C/O is the relative paucity of carbon dwarf stars (10-3--10-5) found in large samples of low-mass stars. We suggest reasons for this overestimation, including a high C/O ratio for the solar atmosphere model used for differential abundance analysis, the treatment of a Ni blend that affects the O abundance, and limitations of one-dimensional LTE stellar atmosphere models. Furthermore, from the estimated errors on the measured stellar C/O ratios, we find that the significance of the high C/O tail is weakened, with a true measured fraction of C/O {$>$} 0.8 in 10\%--15\% of stars, and C/O {$>$} 1.0 in 1\%--5\%, although these are still likely overestimates. We suggest that infrared T-dwarf spectra could show how common high C/O is in the stellar neighborhood, as the chemistry and spectra of such objects would differ compared to those with solar-like abundances. While possible at C/O {$>$} 0.8, we expect that carbon-dominated rocky planets are rarer than others have suggested.},

GJ 1214b is a well-studied example whose atmospheric transmission spectrum has been observed by many investigators. Here we take a step back from GJ 1214b to investigate the role that planetary mass, composition, and temperature play in impacting the transmission spectra of these low-mass low-density (LMLD) planets. Under the assumption that these planets accrete modest hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and planetesimals, we use population synthesis models to show that predicted metal enrichments of the H/He envelope are high, with metal mass fraction Zenv values commonly 0.6--0.9, or {$\sim$}100--400+ times solar. The high mean molecular weight of such atmospheres ({$\mu$} {$\approx$} 5--12) would naturally help to flatten the transmission spectrum of most LMLD planets. The high metal abundance would also provide significant condensible material for cloud formation. It is known that the H/He abundance in Uranus and Neptune decreases with depth, and we show that atmospheric evaporation of LMLD planets could expose atmospheric layers with gradually higher Zenv. However, values of Zenv close to solar composition can also arise, so diversity should be expected. Photochemically produced hazes, potentially due to methane photolysis, are another possibility for obscuring transmission spectra. Such hazes may not form above Teq of {$\sim$}800--1100 K, which is testable if such warm, otherwise low mean molecular weight atmospheres are stable against atmospheric evaporation. We find that available transmission data are consistent with relatively high mean molecular weight atmospheres for GJ 1214b and ``warm Neptune'' GJ 436b. We examine future prospects for characterizing GJ 1214b with Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope.},

These differences last a few tens of millions of years. Young giant planets are intrinsically fainter than has been previously appreciated.

It also summarizes known and newly discovered spectroscopic binaries, and stars known to belong to visual multiple systems. A calibration of the projected rotation velocity versus measured line widths for M dwarfs observed by the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter is derived, and the resulting values are compared to equatorial rotation velocities deduced from rotation periods and radii. A comparison of the derived effective temperatures and metallicities with literature values is also conducted. Finally, the radial-velocity uncertainty of each star in the sample is estimated, to narrow down the selection of stars to be included into the SPIC.},

  abstract = {Context. The rotation period of stars is an important parameter together with mass, radius, and effective temperature. It is an essential parameter for any radial velocity monitoring, as stellar activity can mimic the presence of a planet at the stellar rotation period. Several methods exist to measure it, including long sequences of photometric measurements or temporal series of stellar activity indicators. Aims: Here, we use the circular polarization in near-infrared spectral lines for a sample of 43 quiet M dwarfs and compare the measured rotation periods to those obtained with other methods. Methods: From Stokes V spectropolarimetric sequences observed with SPIRou at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the data processed with the APERO pipeline, we computed the least-squares deconvolution profiles using different masks of atomic stellar lines with known Land{\'e} factor appropriate to the effective temperature of the star. We derived the longitudinal magnetic field to examine its possible variation in 50 to 200 observations of each star. To determine the stellar rotation period, we applied a Gaussian process regression, enabling us to determine the rotation period of stars with evolving longitudinal field. Results: We were able to measure a rotation period for 27 of the 43 stars of our sample. The rotation period was previously unknown for 8 of these stars. Our rotation periods agree well with periods found in the literature based on photometry and activity indicators, and we confirm that near-infrared spectropolarimetry is an important tool for measuring rotation periods, even for magnetically quiet stars. Furthermore, we computed the ages for 20 stars of our sample using gyrochronology.

The data were obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. Moderate-resolution spectra (R{$\approx$} 17,000--18,000) obtained in the 1150--1750 {\AA} and 2770--2830 {\AA} bandpasses reveal H2 emission excited by H i Ly{$\alpha$} photons, several ionization states of carbon (C i--C iv), and hot gas emission lines of He ii and N v (T {$\approx$} 104--105 K). Emission from some species that would be found in a typical thermal plasma at this temperature (Si ii, Si iii, Si iv, and Mg ii) is not detected. The non-detections indicate that these refractory elements are depleted into grains, and that accretion shocks dominate the production of the hot gas observed on 2MASS J12073346-3932539. We use the observed C iv luminosity to constrain the mass accretion rate in this system. We use the kinematically broadened H2 profile to confirm that the majority of the molecular emission arises in the disk, measure the radius of the inner hole of the disk (Rhole {$\approx$} 3R*), and constrain the physical conditions of the warm molecular phase of the disk (T(H2) {$\approx$} 2500--4000 K). A second, most likely unresolved H2 component is identified. This feature is either near the stellar surface in the region of the accretion shock or in a molecular outflow, although the possibility that this Jovian-like emission arises on the dayside disk of a 6 MJ companion (2M1207b) cannot be conclusively ruled out. In general, we find that this young brown dwarf disk system is a low-mass analog to classical T Tauri stars that are observed to produce H2 emission from a warm layer in their disks, such as the well-studied TW Hya and DF Tau systems.},

Born a few hundred million after the Big Bang and during a time that marked the very beginning of the chemical evolution, these stars display very low abundances of elements heavier and hydrogen and helium, making them "metal-poor". Studying the chemical composition of these stars reveals direct information about the conditions of the early universe because each of them has long preserved the local chemical signature of their individual birth gas clouds in their stellar atmosphere. There are many different types of metal-poor stars, each of them providing information on a different element production history that occurred prior to their own births. Large samples of metal-poor stars enable the reconstruction of nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of our Galaxy, early star formation processes, and various aspects of the assembly and evolution of the Milky Way.},

Calculations span 1 {$\mu$}bar to 300 bar, and 75--4000 K, in a nearly square grid. Opacities at metallicities from solar to 50 times solar abundances are calculated. We also provide an analytic fit to the Rosseland mean opacities over the grid in pressure, temperature, and metallicity. In addition to computing mean opacities at these local temperatures, we also calculate them with weighting functions up to 7000 K, to simulate the mean opacities for incident stellar intensities, rather than locally thermally emitted intensities. The chemical equilibrium calculations account for the settling of condensates in a gravitational field and are applicable to cloud-free giant planet and ultracool dwarf atmospheres, but not circumstellar disks. We provide our extensive opacity tables for public use.},

The simulations cover the very top of the convection zone and the photosphere including the dust layers for a sequence of effective temperatures between 900 K and 2800 K, all with log g = 5 assuming solar chemical composition. Results. Convective overshoot occurs in the form of exponentially declining velocities with small scale heights, so that it affects only the region immediately above the almost adiabatic convective layers. From there on, mixing is provided by gravity waves that are strong enough to maintain thin dust clouds in the hotter models. With decreasing effective temperature, the amplitudes of the waves become smaller but the clouds become thicker and develop internal convective flows that are more efficient in transporting and mixing material than gravity waves. The presence of clouds often leads to a highly structured appearance of the stellar surface on short temporal and small spatial scales (presently inaccessible to observations). Conclusions. We identify convectively excited gravity waves as an essential mixing process in M dwarf and brown dwarf atmospheres. Under conditions of strong cloud formation, dust convection is the dominant self-sustaining mixing component.},

  abstract = {It is clearly established that the Sun has an 11-yr cycle that is caused by its internal magnetic field. Such a cycle is also observed in a sample of M dwarfs. In the framework of exoplanet detection or atmospheric characterisation of exoplanets, the activity status of the host star plays a crucial role, and inactive states are preferable for such studies. This means that it is important to know the activity cycles of these stars. We study systematic long-term variability in a sample of 211 M dwarfs observed with CARMENES, the high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectrograph at Calar Alto Observatory. In an automatic search using time series of different activity indicators, we identified 26 stars with linear or quadratic trends or with potentially cyclic behaviour. Additionally, we performed an independent search in archival R{$\prime$}HK data collected from different instruments whose time baselines were usually much longer. These data are available for a subset of 186 of our sample stars. Our search revealed 22 cycle candidates in the data. We found that the percentage of stars showing long-term variations drops dramatically to the latest M dwarfs. Moreover, we found that the pseudo-equivalent width (pEW) of the H{$\alpha$} and Ca II infrared triplet more often triggers automatic detections of long-term variations than the TiO index, differential line width, chromatic index, or radial velocity. This is in line with our comparison of the median relative amplitudes of the different indicators. For stars that trigger our automatic detection, this leads to the highest amplitude variation in R{$\prime$}HK, followed by pEW(H{$\alpha$}), pEW(CaII IRT), and the TiO index.},

This sample includes 79 new candidate young brown dwarfs and 22 planetary-mass objects. These candidates were identified through the first systematic all-sky survey for late-type low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in YMGs. We cross-matched the Two Micron All Sky Survey and AllWISE catalogs outside of the galactic plane to build a sample of 98,970 potential M5 dwarfs in the solar neighborhood and calculated their proper motions with typical precisions of 5--15 mas yr-1. We selected highly probable candidate members of several YMGs from this sample using the Bayesian Analysis for Nearby Young AssociatioNs II tool (BANYAN II). We used the most probable statistical distances inferred from BANYAN II to estimate the spectral type and mass of these candidate YMG members. We used this unique sample to show tentative signs of mass segregation in the AB Doradus moving group and the Tucana-Horologium and Columba associations. The BASS sample has already been successful in identifying several new young brown dwarfs in earlier publications, and will be of great interest in studying the initial mass function of YMGs and for the search of exoplanets by direct imaging; the input sample of potential close-by M5 dwarfs will be useful to study the kinematics of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs and search for new proper motion pairs.},

We confirm signs of low gravity for 42 new BD discoveries with estimated masses between 8 and 75 and identify previously unrecognized signs of low gravity for 24 known BDs. We refine the fraction of low-gravity dwarfs in the high-probability BASS sample to {$\sim$}82\%. We use this unique sample of 66 young BDs, supplemented with 22 young BDs from the literature, to construct new empirical NIR absolute magnitude and color sequences for low-gravity BDs. We show that low-resolution NIR spectroscopy alone cannot differentiate between the ages of YMGs younger than {$\sim$}120 Myr, and that the BT-Settl atmosphere models do not reproduce well the dust clouds in field or low-gravity L-type dwarfs. We obtain a spectroscopic confirmation of low gravity for 2MASS J14252798--3650229, which is a new {$\sim$}27 , L4 {$\gamma$} bona fide member of AB Doradus. We identify a total of 19 new low-gravity candidate members of YMGs with estimated masses below 13 , 7 of which have kinematically estimated distances within 40 pc. These objects will be valuable benchmarks for a detailed atmospheric characterization of planetary-mass objects with the next generation of instruments. We find 16 strong candidate members of the Tucana--Horologium association with estimated masses between 12.5 and 14 , a regime where our study was particularly sensitive. This would indicate that for this association there is at least one isolated object in this mass range for every main-sequence stellar member, a number significantly higher than expected based on standard log-normal initial mass function, however, in the absence of radial velocity and parallax measurements for all of them, it is likely that this over-density is caused by a number of young interlopers from other associations.},

  abstract = {BANYAN{$\Sigma$} is a new Bayesian algorithm to identify members of young stellar associations within 150 pc of the Sun. It includes 27 young associations with ages in the range {$\sim$}1--800 Myr, modeled with multivariate Gaussians in six-dimensional (6D) XYZUVW space. It is the first such multi-association classification tool to include the nearest sub-groups of the Sco-Cen OB star-forming region, the IC2602, IC2391, Pleiades and Platais8 clusters, and the {$\rho$}Ophiuchi, Corona Australis, and Taurus star formation regions. A model of field stars is built from a mixture of multivariate Gaussians based on the Besan{\c c}on Galactic model. The algorithm can derive membership probabilities for objects with only sky coordinates and proper motion, but can also include parallax and radial velocity measurements, as well as spectrophotometric distance constraints from sequences in color--magnitude or spectral type--magnitude diagrams. BANYAN{$\Sigma$} benefits from an analytical solution to the Bayesian marginalization integrals over unknown radial velocities and distances that makes it more accurate and significantly faster than its predecessor BANYANII. A contamination versus hit rate analysis is presented and demonstrates that BANYAN{$\Sigma$} achieves a better classification performance than other moving group tools available in the literature, especially in terms of cross-contamination between young associations. An updated list of bona fide members in the 27 young associations, augmented by the Gaia-DR1 release, as well as all parameters for the 6D multivariate Gaussian models for each association and the Galactic field neighborhood within 300 pc are presented. This new tool will make it possible to analyze large data sets such as the upcoming Gaia-DR2 to identify new young stars. IDL and Python versions of BANYAN{$\Sigma$} are made available with this publication, and a more limited online web tool is available at http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/banyan/banyansigma.php.},

We obtained near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for both objects (NIR spectral types are respectively L1 and M9), as well as optical spectroscopy for J1207-3900 (optical spectral type is L0{$\gamma$}), and show that both display clear signs of low gravity, and thus youth. We use the BANYAN II Bayesian inference tool to show that both objects are candidate members to TWA with a very low probability of being field contaminants, although the kinematics of J1247-3816 seem slightly at odds with that of other TWA members. J1207-3900 is currently the latest-type and the only isolated L-type candidate member of TWA. Measuring the distance and radial velocity of both objects is still required to claim them as bona fide members. Such late-type objects are predicted to have masses down to 11--15 MJup at the age of TWA, which makes them compelling targets to study atmospheric properties in a regime similar to that of currently known imaged extrasolar planets.},

  abstract = {Methods. The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. Results. Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (GBP - GRP) colour are also available. The passbands for G, GBP, and GRP are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Conclusions. Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30--40\% for the parallaxes and by a factor {$\sim$}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, GBP, and GRP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1\% level},

Many companions and isolated targets have also shown spectral variability. In this work we observed the super-Jupiter AB Pictoris b across four consecutive nights using VLT/CRIRES+ as part of the ESO SupJup survey, exploring how the constraints on the chemical composition and temperature profile change over time. We performed atmospheric retrievals of the high-resolution observations and found good consistency across all four nights, indicating that the atmosphere is relatively stable across the timescale of {$\sim$}days. We clearly detect H2O, 12CO and 13CO in each night owing to their strong absorption features in the K-band of the observations. We did find some small differences in the deep atmosphere temperature profile as well as the 12C/13C ratios across each night, but these were within 1-2{$\sigma$}. Our combined retrieval simultaneously analysing all four nights together found the C/O to be 0.59 {\textpm} 0.01, consistent with solar composition, and 12C/13C = 102 {\textpm} 8, slightly higher than the ISM and Solar System values. We also find a low projected rotational velocity, suggesting that the spin axis is observed pole-on and that there is an {$\sim$} 90{\textopenbullet} misalignment with its orbit inclination. This hints that AB Pictoris b might be rolling along its orbit like Uranus. Future ground and space observations will be able to explore variability and orbit of AB Pictoris b and other companions further.},

All metallicity measurements are homogeneously obtained through the same methodology based on the near-infrared spectra collected with a single instrument SpeX mounted on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We find that 1) giant planets favor metal-rich M dwarfs at a 4-5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence level, depending on the band of spectra used to derive metallicity; 2) hot (\$a/R\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textbackslash}leq 20\$) and warm (\$a/R\_{\textbackslash}ast{$>$} 20\$) Jupiters do not show a significant difference in the metallicity distribution. Our results suggest that giant planets around M and FGK stars, which are already known to prefer metal-rich hosts, probably have a similar formation channel. In particular, hot and warm Jupiters around M dwarfs may have the same origin as they have indistinguishable metallicity distributions. With the refined stellar and planetary parameters, we examine the stellar metallicities and the masses of giant planets where we find no significant correlation. M dwarfs with multi-giant planets as well as mid-to-late type M stars hosting gas giants do not show an apparent preference to higher metallicities.},

  abstract = {Twenty-six years ago a small committee report, building on earlier studies, expounded a compelling and poetic vision for the future of astronomy, calling for an infrared-optimized space telescope with an aperture of at least 4 m. With the support of their governments in the US, Europe, and Canada, 20,000 people realized that vision as the 6.5 m James Webb Space Telescope. A generation of astronomers will celebrate their accomplishments for the life of the mission, potentially as long as 20 yr, and beyond. This report and the scientific discoveries that follow are extended thank-you notes to the 20,000 team members. The telescope is working perfectly, with much better image quality than expected. In this and accompanying papers, we give a brief history, describe the observatory, outline its objectives and current observing program, and discuss the inventions and people who made it possible. We cite detailed reports on the design and the measured performance on orbit.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric retrievals (AR) characterize exoplanets by estimating atmospheric parameters from observed light spectra, typically by framing the task as a Bayesian inference problem. However, traditional approaches such as nested sampling are computationally expensive, thus sparking an interest in solutions based on machine learning (ML). In this ongoing work, we first explore flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) as a new ML-based method for AR and find that, in our case, it is more accurate than neural posterior estimation (NPE), but less accurate than nested sampling. We then combine both FMPE and NPE with importance sampling, in which case both methods outperform nested sampling in terms of accuracy and simulation efficiency. Going forward, our analysis suggests that simulation-based inference with likelihood-based importance sampling provides a framework for accurate and efficient AR that may become a valuable tool not only for the analysis of observational data from existing telescopes, but also for the development of new missions and instruments.},

  abstract = {Classical novae, explosions that result from thermonuclear runaways (TNRs) on the surfaces of white dwarfs (WDs) accreting hydrogen-rich matter in close binary systems, are sporadically injecting material processed by explosive hydrogen-burning nucleosynthesis into the interstellar medium (ISM). Although novae probably have processed less than {$\sim$}0.3\% of the interstellar matter in the Galaxy, both theoretical and observational evidence suggests that they may be important sources of the nuclides 7Li, 15N, and 17O, as well as the radioactive isotopes 22Na and 26Al. The latter nuclides are astrophysically important in that they may have been involved in the production of the 22Ne (Ne-E) and 26Mg enrichments identified in meteoritic inclusions, the composition of which is thought to be representative of the chemical and mineral contents of the primitive solar nebula. These inclusions may be partially composed of dust condensed in nova outbursts. We review theoretical expectations for the yields of various isotopes in nova outbursts and conclude that any of the heavy isotope anomalies attributable to novae are most likely produced by the approximately 25\%--33\% of novae that occur in systems containing massive (M*{$>$}1.2 M{$\odot$}) oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg) WDs. We attempt to place quantitative constraints on the degree to which classical novae participate in the production of chemical anomalies, both in the primitive solar system and on a Galactic scale. Diffuse Galactic {$\gamma$}-ray fluxes provide particularly important clues to and constraints on the 22Na and 26Al yields from novae. Ultraviolet (UV), optical, and infrared (IR) emission-line spectra of classical novae reveal the abundances of some of the gas-phase elements present in the ejecta; recent results are reviewed. We describe how IR observations of novae reveal dust formation and gas-phase line emission and how they distinguish the temporal development of nova explosions on carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs (CO novae) from those on ONeMg WDs (ONeMg or ``neon'' novae). Recent studies show that the ejecta in some novae can be strongly cooled by near- and mid-IR forbidden-line radiation from highly ionized (``coronal'') atomic states. We compare the abundances deduced from recent UV, optical, and IR observations with theoretical predictions, and we suggest that future studies of IR coronal emission lines may provide additional key information. Novae produce only about 0.1\% of the Galactic ``stardust'' (dust condensed in stellar outflows), but IR observations show that it may be some of the more interesting dust. Novae appear capable of producing astrophysical dust of virtually every known chemical and mineral composition. We summarize recent IR observations of the dust production scenario in novae and argue that neon novae may lead to the formation of dust grains that carry the Ne-E and 26Mg anomalies.},

  abstract = {Physically realistic models of stellar spectra are needed in a variety of astronomical studies, from the analysis of fundamental stellar parameters, to studies of exoplanets and stellar populations in galaxies. Here we present a new version of the widely used radiative transfer code Turbospectrum, which we update so that it is able to perform spectrum synthesis for lines of multiple chemical elements in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE). We use the code in the analysis of metallicites and abundances of the Gaia FGK benchmark stars, using 1D MARCS atmospheric models and the averages of 3D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of stellar surface convection. We show that the new more physically realistic models offer a better description of the observed data, and we make the program and the associated microphysics data publicly available, including grids of NLTE departure coefficients for H, O, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Sr, and Ba.},

  abstract = {Stellar, substellar, and planetary atmosphere models are all highly sensitive to the input opacities. Generational differences between various state-of-the-art stellar/planetary models arise primarily because of incomplete and outdated atomic/molecular line lists. Here we present a database of precomputed absorption cross sections for all isotopologues of key atmospheric molecules relevant to late-type stellar, brown dwarf, and planetary atmospheres: MgH, AlH, CaH, TiH, CrH, FeH, SiO, TiO, VO, and H2O. The pressure and temperature ranges of the computed opacities are 10-6--3000 bar and 75--4000 K, and their spectral ranges are 0.25--330 {$\mu$}m for many cases where possible. For cases with no pressure-broadening data, we use collision theory to bridge the gap. We also probe the effect of absorption cross sections calculated from different line lists in the context of ultrahot Jupiter and M-dwarf atmospheres. Using 1D self-consistent radiative--convective thermochemical equilibrium models, we report significant variations in the theoretical spectra and thermal profiles of substellar atmospheres. With a 2000 K representative ultrahot Jupiter, we report variations of up to 320 and 80 ppm in transmission and thermal emission spectra, respectively. For a 3000 K M-dwarf, we find differences of up to 125\% in the spectra. We find that the most significant differences arise as a result of the choice of TiO line lists, primarily below 1 {$\mu$}m. In summary, (1) we present a database of precomputed molecular absorption cross sections, and (2) we quantify biases that arise when characterizing substellar/exoplanet atmospheres as a result of differences in the line lists, therefore highlighting the importance of correct and complete opacities for eventual applications to high-precision spectroscopy and photometry.},

  abstract = {When computing cross-sections from a line list, the result depends not only on the line strength, but also the line shape, pressure-broadening parameters, and line wing cut-off (i.e. the maximum distance calculated from each line centre). Pressure-broadening can be described using the Lorentz line shape, but it is known to not represent the true absorption in the far wings. Both theory and experiment have shown that far from the line centre, non-Lorentzian behaviour controls the shape of the wings and the Lorentz line shape fails to accurately characterize the absorption, leading to an underestimation or overestimation of the opacity continuum depending on the molecular species involved. The line wing cut-off is an often overlooked parameter when calculating absorption cross-sections, but can have a significant effect on the appearance of the spectrum since it dictates the extent of the line wing that contributes to the calculation either side of every line centre. Therefore, when used to analyse exoplanet and brown dwarf spectra, an inaccurate choice for the line wing cut-off can result in errors in the opacity continuum, which propagate into the modelled transit spectra, and ultimately impact/bias the interpretation of observational spectra, and the derived composition and thermal structure. Here, we examine the different methods commonly utilized to calculate the wing cut-off and propose a standard practice procedure (i.e. absolute value of 25 cm-1 for P {$\leq$} 200 bar and 100 cm-1 for P {$>$} 200 bar) to generate molecular opacities which will be used by the open-access MAESTRO (Molecules and Atoms in Exoplanet Science: Tools and Resources for Opacities) data base. The pressing need for new measurements and theoretical studies of the far-wings is highlighted.},

  abstract = {High-resolution Doppler-resolved spectroscopy has opened up a new window into the atmospheres of both transiting and non-transiting exoplanets. Here, we present VLT/UVES observations of a transit of WASP-121b, an `ultra-hot' Jupiter previously found to exhibit a temperature inversion and detections of multiple species at optical wavelengths. We present initial results using the blue arm of UVES ({$\approx$}3700--5000 {\AA}), recovering a clear signal of neutral Fe in the planet's atmosphere at {$>$}8 {$\sigma$} , which could contribute to (or even fully explain) the temperature inversion in the stratosphere. However, using standard cross-correlation methods, it is difficult to extract physical parameters such as temperature and abundances. Recent pioneering efforts have sought to develop likelihood `mappings' that can be used to directly fit models to high-resolution data sets. We introduce a new framework that directly computes the likelihood of the model fit to the data, and can be used to explore the posterior distribution of parametrised model atmospheres via MCMC techniques. Our method also recovers the physical extent of the atmosphere, as well as account for time- and wavelength-dependent uncertainties. We measure a temperature of 3710+-459100 K, indicating a higher temperature in the upper atmosphere when compared to low-resolution observations. We also show that the Fe I signal is physically separated from the exospheric Fe II. However, the temperature measurements are highly degenerate with aerosol properties; detection of additional species, using more sophisticated atmospheric models, or combining these methods with low-resolution spectra should help break these degeneracies.},

Previous observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-31b using transmission spectroscopy at low resolution have presented conflicting results. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations detected a strong potassium feature at high significance (4.2{$\sigma$} ), which subsequent ground-based spectrophotometry with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) failed to reproduce. Here, we present high-resolution observations (R {$>$} 80 000) of WASP-31b with the UVES spectrograph, in an effort to resolve this discrepancy. We perform a comprehensive search for potassium using differential transit light curves, and integration over the planet's radial velocity. Our observations do not detect K absorption at the level previously reported with HST, consistent with the VLT observations. We measure a differential light curve depth F = 0.00031 {\textpm} 0.00036 using 40 {\AA} bins centred on the planet's K feature, and set an upper limit on the core line depth of F {$\leq$} 0.007 (3{$\sigma$} ) at a few times the resolution limit ({$\approx$}0.24 {\AA}). These results demonstrate that there are still significant limitations to our understanding of instrumental systematics even with our most stable space-based instrumentation, and that care must be taken when extracting narrow band signatures from low-resolution data. Confirming exoplanet features using alternative instruments and methodologies should be a priority, and confronting the limitations of systematics is essential to our future understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.},

  abstract = {The formation of massive planetary or brown dwarf companions at large projected separations from their host star is not yet well understood. In order to put constraints on formation scenarios, we search for signatures in the orbit dynamics of the systems. We are specifically interested in the eccentricities and inclinations since those parameters might tell us about the dynamic history of the systems and where to look for additional low-mass sub-stellar companions. For this purpose, we utilized VLT/NACO to take several well-calibrated high-resolution images of six target systems and analyse them together with available literature data points of those systems as well as Hubble Space Telescope archival data. We used a statistical least-squares Monte Carlo approach to constrain the orbit elements of all systems that showed significant differential motion of the primary star and companion. We show for the first time that the GQ~Lup system shows significant change in both separation and position angle. Our analysis yields best-fitting orbits for this system, which are eccentric (e between 0.21 and 0.69), but cannot rule out circular orbits at high inclinations. Given our astrometry, we discuss formation scenarios of the GQ~Lup system. In addition, we detected an even fainter new companion candidate to GQ~Lup, which is most likely a background object. We also updated the orbit constraints of the PZ~Tel system, confirming that the companion is on a highly eccentric orbit with e~\&gt;~0.62. Finally, we show with a high significance, that there is no orbital motion observed in the cases of the DH~Tau, HD~203030 and 1RXS~J160929.1-210524 systems, and give the most precise relative astrometric measurement of the UScoCTIO~108 system to date.},

  abstract = {Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034 and paired stones represent unique samples of martian polymict regolith breccia. Multiple breccia subsamples characterized in this work confirm highly siderophile element (HSE: Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd) contents that are consistently elevated (e.g., Os {$\sim$}9.3-18.4 ppb) above indigenous martian igneous rocks (mostly {$<$}5 ppb Os), equivalent to {$\sim$}3 wt\% of admixed CI-type carbonaceous chondritic material, and occur in broadly chondrite-relative proportions. However, a protracted history of impactor component (metal and sulfide) breakdown and redistribution of the associated HSE has masked the original nature of the admixed meteorite signatures. The present-day 187Os/188Os ratios of 0.119-0.136 record a wider variation than observed for all major chondrite types. Combined with the measured 187Re/188Os ratios of 0.154-0.994, the range in Os isotope ratios indicates redistribution of Re and Os from originally chondritic components early in the history of the regolith commencing at {$\sim$}4.4 Ga. Superimposed recent Re mobility reflects exposure and weathering at or near the martian and terrestrial surfaces. Elevated Os concentrations (38.0 and 92.6 ppb Os), superchondritic Os/HSE ratios, and 187Os/188Os of 0.1171 and 0.1197 measured for two subsamples of the breccia suggest the redistribution of impactor material at {$\sim$}1.5-1.9 Ga, possibly overlapping with a (partial) resetting event at {$\sim$}1.4 Ga recorded by U-Pb isotope systematics in the breccia. Martian alteration of the originally chondritic HSE host phases, to form Os-Ir-rich nuggets and Ni-rich pyrite, implies the influence of potentially impact-driven hydrothermal systems. Multiple generations of impactor component admixture, redistribution, and alteration mark the formation and evolution of the martian regolith clasts and matrix of NWA 7034 and paired meteorites, from the pre-Noachian until impact ejection to Earth.},

In this tutorial review, we summarize how the measurement of isotope ratios can expand our knowledge of the processes that took place before and during the formation of our Solar System and its subsequent early evolution. The continuous improvement of mass spectrometers with high precision and increased spatial resolution, including secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) and multi collector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS), along with the ever growing amounts of available extraterrestrial samples have significantly increased the temporal and spatial constraints on the sequence of events that took place since and before the formation of the first Solar System condensates (               i.e.               , Ca--Al-rich inclusions). Grains sampling distinct stellar environments with a wide range of isotopic compositions were admixed to, but possibly not fully homogenized in, the Sun's parent molecular cloud or the nascent Solar System. Before, during and after accretion of the nebula, as well as the formation and subsequent evolution of planetesimals and planets, chemical and physical fractionation processes irrevocably changed the chemical and isotopic compositions of all Solar System bodies. Since the formation of the first Solar System minerals and rocks 4.568 Gyr ago, short- and long-lived radioactive decay and cosmic ray interaction also contributed to the modification of the isotopic framework of the Solar System, and permit to trace the formation and evolution of directly accessible and inferred planetary and stellar isotopic reservoirs.},

  abstract = {Reflection spectroscopy holds great promise for characterizing the atmospheres and surfaces of potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanets. The surface of the modern Earth exhibits a sharp albedo change near 750 nm caused by vegetation ---the red edge---which would leave a strong spectral signature if present on an exoplanet. However, the retrieval of wavelength-dependent surface properties from reflection spectra has seen relatively little study. Here, we propose a new surface albedo parameterization capable of retrieving the wavelength location of a priori unknown ``edge-like'' features. We demonstrate that a wavelength-dependent surface albedo model achieves higher accuracy in retrieving atmospheric composition than a uniform albedo model.Wavelength-dependent surfaces are also generally preferred over a uniform albedo model when retrieving simulated reflection spectra for a modern Earth analog, even for moderate signal-to-noise ratios (S/N = 10) and Earth-like clouds. Further, the location of the modern Earth's red edge can be robustly and precisely constrained (within 70 nm for S/N = 10). Our results suggest that future space-based direct-imaging missions have the potential to infer surface compositions for rocky exoplanets, including spectral edges similar to those caused by life on the modern Earth.},

In a separate analysis, we determined the 12C/13C of GQ Lup A using PHOENIX models with varying 12C/13C values. Results. We determined the abundances of key molecular species in the atmosphere of GQ Lup B, including H2O and 12CO, along with trace species 13CO and HF, and atomic species Na, Ca, and Ti. Additionally, we derived a C/O ratio of 0.50 {\textpm} 0.01, consistent with the solar value ({$\sim$}0.59) and we measured a carbon isotope ratio of 12C/13C = 53+-76. Similarly, GQ Lup A exhibited a 12C/13C of 51+-96, aligning closely with the value observed in GQ Lup B. Furthermore, we identified strong veiling in the spectrum of GQ Lup A, which we include in our analysis. Conclusions. The similar 12C/13C values in GQ Lup B and GQ Lup A suggest a common origin from the same material reservoir supporting the theory that the companion formed via disk fragmentation or gravitational collapse.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context{$<$}i/{$>$}. Young brown dwarfs exhibit atmospheric characteristics similar to those of super-Jupiters, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary atmospheres. Atmospheric retrievals of high-resolution spectra reveal detailed properties of these objects, with elemental and isotopic ratios offering insights into their formation history. The ESO SupJup Survey, utilising CRIRES\textsuperscript{+{$<$}sup/{$>$} on the Very Large Telescope, aims to assess the role of \textsuperscript{12{$<$}sup/{$>$}C/\textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}C as a formation tracer.\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}. We present observations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and 2MASS J08561384-1342242. Our goal is to constrain their chemical compositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and \textsuperscript{12{$<$}sup/{$>$}C/\textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}C.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. We conducted atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES\textsuperscript{+{$<$}sup/{$>$} \emph{K{$<$}i/{$>$}-band spectra, coupling the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS with the Bayesian inference algorithm MultiNest.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. The retrievals provide a detailed characterisation of the atmospheres of the three objects.

We also report tentative evidence ({\textasciitilde}2\emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$}) of \textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}CO in J1200, at \textsuperscript{12{$<$}sup/{$>$}C/\textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}C = 114\textsubscript{-33{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+69{$<$}sup/{$>$}.

The retrieved thermal profiles are consistent with hot atmospheres (2300--2600 K) with low surface gravities and slow spins, as expected for young objects.\emph{Conclusions{$<$}i/{$>$}. The measured carbon isotope ratios are consistent among the three objects and show no significant deviation from that of the local interstellar medium, suggesting a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar to star formation. The tentative detection of H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{18{$<$}sup/{$>$}O in two objects of our sample highlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional isotope ratios, such as \textsuperscript{16{$<$}sup/{$>$}O/\textsuperscript{18{$<$}sup/{$>$}O, in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {This paper describes the contents of the 2016 edition of the HITRAN molecular spectroscopic compilation. The new edition replaces the previous HITRAN edition of 2012 and its updates during the intervening years. The HITRAN molecular absorption compilation is composed of five major components: the traditional line-by-line spectroscopic parameters required for high-resolution radiative-transfer codes, infrared absorption cross-sections for molecules not yet amenable to representation in a line-by-line form, collision-induced absorption data, aerosol indices of refraction, and general tables such as partition sums that apply globally to the data. The new HITRAN is greatly extended in terms of accuracy, spectral coverage, additional absorption phenomena, added line-shape formalisms, and validity. Moreover, molecules, isotopologues, and perturbing gases have been added that address the issues of atmospheres beyond the Earth. Of considerable note, experimental IR cross-sections for almost 300 additional molecules important in different areas of atmospheric science have been added to the database. The compilation can be accessed through www.hitran.org. Most of the HITRAN data have now been cast into an underlying relational database structure that offers many advantages over the long-standing sequential text-based structure. The new structure empowers the user in many ways. It enables the incorporation of an extended set of fundamental parameters per transition, sophisticated line-shape formalisms, easy user-defined output formats, and very convenient searching, filtering, and plotting of data. A powerful application programming interface making use of structured query language (SQL) features for higher-level applications of HITRAN is also provided.},

We compare the spectra of giants and young M dwarfs (of low gravity) to field M and L dwarfs (of high gravity) and to model spectra from the Lyon group. We find that low-resolution spectra of M4-M9 stars and young brown dwarfs at R{\textasciitilde}350 and signal-to-noise ratios greater than 70 can determine the spectral type to a precision of +/-1 subtype using the H2O and CO bands and can measure the surface gravity to +/-0.5 dex using the atomic lines of K I and Na I. This result points toward the development of photometric spectral indices to separate low-mass members from foreground and background objects in young clusters and associations. We also emphasize the complexity of the interpretation of the empirical quantities (e.g., spectral types) in terms of the physical variables (e.g., temperature, opacities) in the cool atmospheres of young brown dwarfs.

Here we present a technique for detecting the rotational sub-band structure of CO at medium resolution with the NIRSpec G395H instrument. We use a single transit observation of the hot Jupiter WASP-39b from the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science (JTEC ERS) program at the native resolution of the instrument (R {$\sim$} 2700) to resolve the CO absorption structure. We robustly detect absorption by CO, with an increase in transit depth of 264 {\textpm} 68 ppm, in agreement with the predicted CO contribution from the best-fit model at low resolution. This detection confirms our theoretical expectations that CO is the dominant carbon-bearing molecule in WASP-39b's atmosphere and further supports the conclusions of low C/O and supersolar metallicities presented in the JTEC ERS papers for WASP-39b.},

Stellar brightness is maximal at the centre and then decreases radially and monotonically towards the limb -- hence the term "limb darkening". This effect is crucial for finding and characterising planets beyond our Solar System, known as exoplanets, as these planets are often studied when crossing in front of their host stars. As such, limb darkening is directly linked to the exoplanet signals. Limb darkening is typically modelled by one of various functional forms, as outlined in Claret (2000) and Sing (2010), and the coefficients of these functions is what ExoTiC-LD is designed to compute. A wide variety of functional forms are supported, including those benchmarked by Espinoza \& Jord{\'a}n (2016) as well as reparameterisations suggested by Kipping (2013).},

  abstract = {Clouds are prevalent in many of the exoplanet atmospheres that have been observed to date. For transiting exoplanets, we know if clouds are present because they mute spectral features and cause wavelength-dependent scattering. While the exact composition of these clouds is largely unknown, this information is vital to understanding the chemistry and energy budget of planetary atmospheres. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot Jupiter WASP-17b with JWST's Mid-Infrared InstrumentLow Resolution Spectrometer and generate a transmission spectrum from 5 to 12 {$\mu$}m. These wavelengths allow us to probe absorption due to the vibrational modes of various predicted cloud species. Our transmission spectrum shows additional opacity centered at 8.6 {$\mu$}m, and detailed atmospheric modeling and retrievals identify this feature as SiO2(s) (quartz) clouds. The SiO2(s) clouds model is preferred at 3.5--4.2{$\sigma$} versus a cloud-free model and at 2.6{$\sigma$} versus a generic aerosol prescription. We find the SiO2(s) clouds are composed of small {$\sim$}0.01 {$\mu$}m particles, which extend to high altitudes in the atmosphere. The atmosphere also shows a depletion of H2O, a finding consistent with the formation of high-temperature aerosols from oxygen-rich species. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we will use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).},

Atmospheric models are generated with the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS, for which we employ a free-chemistry approach, which we couple with the PyMultiNest sampling algorithm to determine the best fit through the log-likelihood. Results. We report robust detections of 13CO (13 \& 8 {$\sigma$}) and HF (11.6 \& 15.8 {$\sigma$}) in 2M0355 and 2M1425, respectively. Both objects have similar overall atmospheric properties, including their isotope ratios of 12CO/13CO being 95.5+-66..84 for 2M0355 and 109.6+-190..66 for 2M1425. The most notable difference is the robust evidence of CH4 (5.5 {$\sigma$}) but no H2S ({$<$} 2.3 {$\sigma$}) in 2M1425, in contrast to 2M0355, where we retrieve H2S (4.6 {$\sigma$}) but not CH4 ({$<$} 2.2 {$\sigma$}). Both objects appear to be affected by chemical disequilibrium processes to some degree. In both brown dwarfs, we find only tentative hints of H128O (1.1 \& 3 {$\sigma$}). We also find that 2M1425 appears to be 50--200 K hotter than 2M0355 and has a higher surface gravity. Conclusions. Retrievals of high-resolution K-band spectroscopy of young brown dwarfs enable a detailed insight into their atmospheres and add to the growing sample of analyzed SupJup objects. As with similar targets, these brown dwarfs also exhibit a depletion of 13CO compared to the interstellar medium.},

We broaden our previous analysis to other young nearby associations to determine the frequency, mass, and separation of companions in general and JL in particular and their dependencies on the mass and age of the associations. We collected available data about companions including those revealed by visual observations, eclipses, spectroscopy, and astrometry. We determined search completeness and found that it is very high for stellar companions, while completeness corrections are still large for JL companions. Once these corrections are included, we found a high frequency of companions, both stellar ({$>$}0.52+/-0.03) and JL (0.57+/-0.11). The two populations are separated by a gap that corresponds to the brown dwarf desert. Within the population of massive companions, we found trends in frequency, separation, and mass ratios with stellar mass. Planetary companions pile up in the region just outside the ice line and we found them to be frequent once completeness was considered. The frequency of JL planets decreases with the overall mass and possibly the age of the association. We tentatively identify the two populations as due to disk fragmentation and core accretion, respectively. The distributions of stellar companions with a semi-major axis {$<$}1000 au is well reproduced by a simple model of formation by disk fragmentation. The observed trends with stellar mass can be explained by a shorter but much more intense phase of accretion onto the disk of massive stars and by a more steady and prolonged accretion on solar-type stars. Possible explanations for the trends in the population of JL planets with association mass and age are briefly discussed.},

Thanks to the sensitivity and the better spatial frequency coverage of the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, we extended our homogeneous data set of 27 Herbig stars and collected near-infrared K-band interferometric observations of 17 T Tauri stars, spanning effective temperatures and luminosities in the ranges of {$\sim$}4000--6000 K and {$\sim$}0.4--10 L , respectively. We focus on the continuum emission and develop semi-physical geometrical models to fit the interferometric data and search for trends between the properties of the disk and the central star. Results. As for those of their more massive counterparts, the Herbig Ae/Be stars, the best-fit models of the inner rim of the T Tauri disks correspond to wide rings. The GRAVITY measurements extend the radius-luminosity relation toward the smallest luminosities (0.4--10 L ). As observed previously, in this range of luminosities, the R {$\propto$} L1/2 trend line is no longer valid, and the K-band sizes measured with GRAVITY appear to be larger than the predicted sizes derived from sublimation radius computation. We do not see a clear correlation between the K-band half-flux radius and the mass accretion rate onto the central star. Besides, having magnetic truncation radii in agreement with the K-band GRAVITY sizes would require magnetic fields as strong as a few kG, which should have been detected, suggesting that accretion is not the main process governing the location of the half-flux radius of the inner dusty disk. The GRAVITY measurements agree with models that take into account the scattered light, which could be as important as thermal emission in the K band for these cool stars. The N-to-K band size ratio may be a proxy for disentangling disks with silicate features in emission from disks with weak and/or in absorption silicate features (i.e., disks with depleted inner regions and/or with large gaps). The GRAVITY data also provide inclinations and position angles of the inner disks. When compared to those of the outer disks derived from ALMA images of nine objects of our sample, we detect clear misalignments between both disks for four objects. Conclusions. The combination of improved data quality with a significant and homogeneous sample of young stellar objects allows us to revisit the pioneering works done on the protoplanetary disks by K-band interferometry and to test inner disk physics such as the inner rim morphology and location.},

Accurate modeling of the star is essential to achieve this goal. We aim to obtain updated stellar parameters for TRAPPIST-1 based on new measurements and evolutionary models, compared to those used in discovery studies. We present a new measurement for the parallax of TRAPPIST-1, 82.4 {\textpm} 0.8 mas, based on 188 epochs of observations with the TRAPPIST and Liverpool Telescopes from 2013 to 2016. This revised parallax yields an updated luminosity of , which is very close to the previous estimate but almost two times more precise. We next present an updated estimate for TRAPPIST-1 stellar mass, based on two approaches: mass from stellar evolution modeling, and empirical mass derived from dynamical masses of equivalently classified ultracool dwarfs in astrometric binaries. We combine them using a Monte-Carlo approach to derive a semi-empirical estimate for the mass of TRAPPIST-1. We also derive estimate for the radius by combining this mass with stellar density inferred from transits, as well as an estimate for the effective temperature from our revised luminosity and radius. Our final results are , , and 2516 {\textpm} 41 K. Considering the degree to which the TRAPPIST-1 system will be scrutinized in coming years, these revised and more precise stellar parameters should be considered when assessing the properties of TRAPPIST-1 planets.},

We have taken two K-band spectra with a resolution of {$\lambda$} /{$\Delta\lambda$} = 700. In here, we analyze the spectra in detail. We show that the shape of spectrum is not spoiled by differences in the Strehl ratio in the blue and in the red part, as well as differential refraction. We reanalyze the spectra and derive the spectral type of the companion using classical methods. We find that the object has a spectral type between M9V and L4V, which corresponds to a T eff between 1600 and 2500 K. Using GAIA-dusty models, we find that the spectral type derivation is robust against different log(g )-values. The T eff derived from the models is again in the range between 1800 and 2400 K. While the models reproduce nicely the general shape of the spectrum, the 12CO lines in the spectrum have about half the depth as those in the model. We speculate that this difference might be caused by veiling, like in other objects of similar age, and spectral class. We also find that the absolute brightness of the companion matches that of other low-mass free-floating objects of similar age and spectral type. A comparison with the objects in USco observed by Mohanty et al. (2004b) shows that the companion of GQ Lup has a lower mass than any of these, as it is of later spectral type, and younger. The same is as true, for the companion of AB Pic. To have a first estimate of the mass of the object we compare the derived T eff and luminosity with those calculated from evolutionary tracks. We also point out that future instruments, like NAHUAL, will finally allow us to derive the masses of such objects more precisely. ({\copyright} 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

  abstract = {Ages and masses of young stars are often estimated by comparing their luminosities and effective temperatures to pre-main-sequence stellar evolution tracks, but magnetic fields and starspots complicate both the observations and evolution. To understand their influence, we study the heavily spotted weak-lined T-Tauri star LkCa 4 by searching for spectral signatures of radiation originating from the starspot or starspot groups. We introduce a new methodology for constraining both the starspot filling factor and the spot temperature by fitting two-temperature stellar atmosphere models constructed from Phoenix synthetic spectra to a high-resolution near-IR IGRINS spectrum. Clearly discernable spectral features arise from both a hot photospheric component \{T\}\{hot\} {$\sim$} 4100 K and a cool component \{T\}\{cool\} {$\sim$} 2700-3000 K, which covers {$\sim$}80\% of the visible surface. This mix of hot and cool emission is supported by analyses of the spectral energy distribution, rotational modulation of colors and of TiO band strengths, and features in low-resolution optical/near-IR spectroscopy. Although the revised effective temperature and luminosity make LkCa 4 appear to be much younger and of much lower mass than previous estimates from unspotted stellar evolution models, appropriate estimates will require the production and adoption of spotted evolutionary models. Biases from starspots likely afflict most fully convective young stars and contribute to uncertainties in ages and age spreads of open clusters. In some spectral regions, starspots act as a featureless ``veiling'' continuum owing to high rotational broadening and heavy line blanketing in cool star spectra. Some evidence is also found for an anticorrelation between the velocities of the warm and cool components.},

  abstract = {The presence of distant protoplanets could explain the observed gaps in dust emission in protoplanetary disks. Here we derive a novel analytical model to describe the temporal decay of the pebble flux through a protoplanetary disk as a result of radial drift. This allows us to investigate the growth and migration of distant protoplanets throughout the lifespan of the disk. We find that early-formed Moon-mass protoplanets can grow to their pebble isolation mass between approximately \$20\$ and \$80{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ within less than \$1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Myr\}\$ in the \$20\$ to \$80{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{AU\}\$ region around solar-like stars. Subsequent fast migration at the early stages of gas accretion after pebble accretion has been halted nevertheless transports these giant planets into final orbits at \${$<\backslash$},\$\$10{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{AU\}\$. However, our pebble decay model allows us to include a new pathway which can trigger the transition from pebble accretion to gas accretion after the pebble flux has decayed substantially. With this pebble decay pathway, we show that it is possible to form gas giants also beyond \$10{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{AU\}\$. The occurrence of these wide-orbit gas giants should be relatively low, since their core must attain sufficient mass to accrete gas before the pebble flux decays while avoiding excessive migration. Since these gas giants do not reach the pebble isolation mass, their heavy element content is typically less than \$10{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$. Our results imply that the observed gaps in protoplanetary disks could be caused by distant protoplanets that reached the pebble isolation mass and then migrated, while gas giants in wide orbits, such as PDS 70 b and c, accreted their gas after the decay in the pebble flux.},

  abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The residuals of the fit indicate the deviation of the veiling spectrum from a simple continuum and identify the location and strength of any emission-line components. It is shown, by means of goodness-of-fit tests, that the spectrum of BP Tau can be decomposed into a normal stellar spectrum plus a smooth veiling continuum with only a few emission lines superposed. The continuum dominates the veiling spectrum in this spectral region; the veiling does not arise from numerous deep photospheric absorption lines that are filled in by weak emission.},

The main aim of our analysis is to explore the Galactic disc--halo transition region within -1.20 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} -0.55 as a means to study chemical difference (and similarities) between these components. In this paper, we show that there is an {$\alpha$}-poor and {$\alpha$}-rich sequence within both the metal-poor and intermediate-metallicity regions. Using the Galactic rest-frame radial velocity and spatial positions, we further separate our sample into the canonical Galactic components. We then studied the abundances ratios of Mg, Ti, Si, Ca, O, S, Al, C+N, Na, Ni, Mn, V, and K for each of the components and found the following: (1) the {$\alpha$}-poor halo subgroup is chemically distinct in the {$\alpha$}-elements, particularly O, Mg, S, Al, C+N, and Ni, from the {$\alpha$}-rich halo, consistent with the literature confirming the existence of an {$\alpha$}-poor accreted halo population; (2) the canonical thick disc and halo are not chemically distinct in all elements indicating a smooth transition between the thick disc and halo; (3) a subsample of the {$\alpha$}-poor stars at metallicities as low as [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -0.85 dex are chemically and dynamically consistent with the thin disc indicating that the thin disc may extend to lower metallicities than previously thought; and (4) the locations of the most metal-poor thin disc stars are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient. Finally, we used our analysis to suggest a new set of chemical abundance planes ([{$\alpha$}/Fe], [C+N/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Mg/Mn]) that may be able to chemically label the Galactic components in a clean and efficient way independent of kinematics.},

Stars in the inner disk (R {$<$} 5 kpc) lie along a single track in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H], starting with {$\alpha$}-enhanced, metal-poor stars and ending at [{$\alpha$}/Fe] {$\sim$} 0 and [Fe/H] {$\sim$} +0.4. At larger radii we find two distinct sequences in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H] space, with a roughly solar-{$\alpha$} sequence that spans a decade in metallicity and a high-{$\alpha$} sequence that merges with the low-{$\alpha$} sequence at super-solar [Fe/H]. The location of the high-{$\alpha$} sequence is nearly constant across the disk however, there are very few high-{$\alpha$} stars at R {$>$} 11 kpc. The peak of the midplane MDF shifts to lower metallicity at larger R, reflecting the Galactic metallicity gradient. Most strikingly, the shape of the midplane MDF changes systematically with radius, from a negatively skewed distribution at 3 {$<$} R {$<$} 7 kpc, to a roughly Gaussian distribution at the solar annulus, to a positively skewed shape in the outer Galaxy. For stars with {\textbar} z{\textbar} 1 kpc or [{$\alpha$}/Fe] {$>$} 0.18, the MDF shows little dependence on R. The positive skewness of the outer-disk MDF may be a signature of radial migration; we show that blurring of stellar populations by orbital eccentricities is not enough to explain the reversal of MDF shape, but a simple model of radial migration can do so.},

  abstract = {Nova outbursts are the results of thermonuclear runaways, which occur when sufficient material accretes on the surfaces of white dwarfs (WDs). Using the MESA code, we construct a detailed grid for carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon-magnesium novae. By employing population synthesis methods, we conduct a statistical analysis of the distribution of novae in the Milky Way. In our models, on average, a typical nova system may undergo about 8000 eruptions and the Galactic nova rate is {$\sim$}130 yr-1. The C, N, and O elements in nova ejecta are strongly affected by the mixing degree between WD core and accreted material. Our results show that the average value of 12C/13C in nova ejecta is about an order of magnitude lower than that on the surface of a red giant, that for 16O/17O is about 5 times lower, and that for 14N/15N is about 1.5 times lower. The annual yields of 13C , 15N, and 17O from nova ejection are larger than those from AGB stars. This indicates that compared to a red giant, nova eruptions are a more important source of the odd-numbered nuclear elements of 13C , 15N, and 17O in the Galactic interstellar medium.},

  abstract = {Nova outbursts are the results of thermonuclear runaways, which occur when sufficient material accretes on the surfaces of white dwarfs (WDs). Using the MESA code, we construct a detailed grid for carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon-magnesium novae. By employing population synthesis methods, we conduct a statistical analysis of the distribution of novae in the Milky Way. In our models, on average, a typical nova system may undergo about 8000 eruptions and the Galactic nova rate is {$\sim$}130 yr-1. The C, N, and O elements in nova ejecta are strongly affected by the mixing degree between WD core and accreted material. Our results show that the average value of 12C/13C in nova ejecta is about an order of magnitude lower than that on the surface of a red giant, that for 16O/17O is about 5 times lower, and that for 14N/15N is about 1.5 times lower. The annual yields of 13C , 15N, and 17O from nova ejection are larger than those from AGB stars. This indicates that compared to a red giant, nova eruptions are a more important source of the odd-numbered nuclear elements of 13C , 15N, and 17O in the Galactic interstellar medium.},

We use the previously determined physical parameters of the star from the literature and infer the abundances of 15 elements---C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni, all with precision {$<$} 0.1 dex---based on model fitting using MARCS model atmospheres and the Turbospectrum spectral synthesis code. Our results show near-solar abundances and a carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) of 0.50 {\textpm} 0.10, which is consistent with the solar value of 0.54 {\textpm} 0.09. The orbiting planet, WASP-107b, is a super-Neptune with a mass in the Neptune regime (=1.8 M Nep) and a radius close to Jupiter's (=0.94 R Jup). This planet is also being targeted by four JWST Cycle 1 programs in transit and eclipse, which should provide highly precise measurements of atmospheric abundances. This will enable us to properly compare the planetary and stellar chemical abundances, which is essential in understanding the formation mechanisms, internal structure, and chemical composition of exoplanets. Our study is a proof-of-concept that will pave the way for such measurements to be made for all of JWST's cooler exoplanet-host stars.},

We show our technique to accurately normalize the observed spectrum, which is crucial for a proper spectral fitting. We also introduce a new automatic, line-by-line, model-fitting code, AutoSpecFit, which performs an iterative {$\chi$} 2 minimization process to measure individual elemental abundances of cool dwarfs. We apply this code to the star K2-18, and measure the abundance of 10 elements: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, and Fe. We find these abundances to be moderately supersolar, except for Fe, with a slightly subsolar abundance. The accuracy of the inferred abundances is limited by the systematic errors due to uncertain stellar parameters. We also derive the abundance ratios associated with several planet-building elements such as Al/Mg, Ca/Mg, Fe/Mg, and (a solar-like) C/O = 0.568 {\textpm} 0.026, which can be used to constrain the chemical composition and the formation location of the exoplanet. On the other hand, the planet K2-18 b has attracted considerable interest, given the JWST measurements of its atmospheric composition. Early JWST studies reveal an unusual chemistry for the atmosphere of this planet, which is unlikely to be driven by formation in a disk of unusual composition. The comparison between the chemical abundances of K2-18 b from future JWST analyses and those of the host star can provide fundamental insights into the formation of this planetary system.},

Our present perception is that brown dwarfs follow the principles of star formation, and that brown dwarfs share many characteristics with planets. Being the darkest and lowest mass stars known makes brown dwarfs also the coolest stars known. This has profound implication for their spectral fingerprints. Brown dwarfs cover a range of effective temperatures which cause brown dwarfs atmospheres to be a sequence that gradually changes from a M-dwarf-like spectrum into a planet-like spectrum. This further implies that below an effective temperature of 2,800 K, clouds form already in atmospheres of objects marking the boundary between M-Dwarfs and brown dwarfs. Recent developments have sparked the interest in plasma processes in such very cool atmospheres: sporadic and quiescent radio emission has been observed in combination with decaying X-ray activity indicators across the fully convective boundary.},

In contrast to the strong spatial variations of most kinematical, physical, and chemical properties, the isotope ratios are more smoothly distributed, thus allowing detailed studies of global anomalies. Modelling the `chemical' evolution during a starburst, the oxygen isotope ratios can be understood in terms of an `overabundance' of {\textasciicircum}18{\textasciicircum}O. This is explained if high mass stars ({$>$}8 M\_sun\_) convert large amounts ({$>$}5\%) of {\textasciicircum}14{\textasciicircum}N into {\textasciicircum}18{\textasciicircum}O and if the burst initial mass function (IMF) is biased in favor of massive stars. Relative to {\textasciicircum}18{\textasciicircum}O, only small amounts of {\textasciicircum}17{\textasciicircum}O are produced in massive stars. Large {\textasciicircum}18{\textasciicircum}O/{\textasciicircum}17{\textasciicircum}O and small {\textasciicircum}16{\textasciicircum}O/{\textasciicircum}18{\textasciicircum}O ratios should be a common signature of the advanced stages of nuclear starbursts. The ejection of large amounts of {\textasciicircum}18{\textasciicircum}O by high mass stars also explains the peculiar solar {\textasciicircum}18{\textasciicircum}O/{\textasciicircum}17{\textasciicircum}O ratio, if the solar system was formed in an OB association. {\textasciicircum}12{\textasciicircum}C/{\textasciicircum}13{\textasciicircum}C ratios are less affected by nuclear starbursts. Therefore, infall of disk gas is likely the main cause for a {\textasciicircum}12{\textasciicircum}C/{\textasciicircum}13{\textasciicircum}C enhancement. The large I({\textasciicircum}12{\textasciicircum}CO)/I({\textasciicircum}13{\textasciicircum}CO) line intensity ratios ({$>$}20) observed in gas-rich mergers are explained (1) by the presence of a molecular `halo' with low {\textasciicircum}13{\textasciicircum}CO intensities, (2) by pre-burst gas masses which are negligible relative to the infalling mass or (3) by infalling gas containing relatively unprocessed material not only from the inner but also from the outer parts of the disks. While the core-halo scenario does not require particularly large {\textasciicircum}12{\textasciicircum}C/{\textasciicircum}13{\textasciicircum}C ratios, the other effects require {\textasciicircum}12{\textasciicircum}C/{\textasciicircum}13{\textasciicircum}C {$>$} 40 in mergers. The Galactic center {\textasciicircum}12{\textasciicircum}C/{\textasciicircum}13{\textasciicircum}C, {\textasciicircum}16{\textasciicircum}O/{\textasciicircum}17{\textasciicircum}O, {\textasciicircum}18{\textasciicircum}O/{\textasciicircum}17{\textasciicircum}O, and {\textasciicircum}14{\textasciicircum}N/{\textasciicircum}15{\textasciicircum}N ratios all support a quiescent state in the recent past. Predictions are made on the spatial distribution of the carbon and oxygen isotope ratios within the burst phase and on the ratios to be expected in ultraluminous mergers and in `normal' spirals. For the Galactic disk, the existence of small interstellar clouds with enhanced {\textasciicircum}18{\textasciicircum}O/{\textasciicircum}17{\textasciicircum}O ratios is postulated. In starbursts, silicon and sulfur isotope ratios are expected to be approximately solar. A qualitative explanation for the Galactic disk, center, and solar system {\textasciicircum}14{\textasciicircum}N/{\textasciicircum}15{\textasciicircum}N ratios is given, implying that the corresponding ratio in nuclear starbursts may be low ({$<$} 200).},

  abstract = {M dwarfs dominate the stellar population, accounting for three of every four stars, the nearest of which is Proxima Centauri, the closest destination beyond our Solar System. These cool stars span large ranges in luminosities (one ten-thousandth to 6\% L{$\odot$}) and temperatures (2,100--3,900 K) and have spectra dominated by absorption bands of titanium oxide (TiO) and, for the latest spectral types, vanadium oxide (VO). They have masses that span 0.075 to 0.61 M{$\odot$}, a factor of eight, which is comparable with a spread in masses for dwarf types mid-B through K. Unlike these more massive stars, in the age of the Universe no M dwarfs have evolved in any significant way. M dwarf systems are multiple roughly one-quarter of the time, with the closest binaries found in orbits that have been circularized via tides for orbital periods of about one week. Unlike any other type of main sequence star, there is a gap in the distribution of M dwarfs near masses of 0.35 M{$\odot$} that pinpoints the separation of partially and fully convective stars, yet both types of M dwarfs are often active, showing both H{$\alpha$} in emission and flares. Many planets are found orbiting M dwarfs, and most of them are terrestrial or neptunian in size, rather than jovian, yet much more work remains to be done to characterize the exoplanet population. Overall, the Solar Neighborhood is dominated by M dwarfs that are likely orbited by many small, as yet unseen, planets---some of which may harbor life very near to that in our Solar System: ▪M dwarfs account for three of every four stars.▪M dwarf counts increase all the way to the end of the main sequence.▪M dwarfs are partially radiative at high masses and fully convective at low masses.},

We report new accretion rates derived from excess Balmer continuum emission for the low-mass stars TW Hya and Hen 3-600A and the brown dwarfs 2MASS J12073347-3932540, UScoCTIO 128, SSSPM J1102-3431, USco J160606.29-233513.3, DENIS-P J160603.9-205644, and Oph J162225-240515B, and upper limits on accretion for the low-mass star Hen 3-600B and the brown dwarfs UScoCTIO 112, Oph J162225-240515A, and USco J160723.82-221102.0. For the six brown dwarfs in our sample that are faintest at short wavelengths, the accretion luminosity or upper limit is measurable only when the image is binned over large wavelength intervals. This method extends our sensitivity to accretion rate down to {$\sim$}10-13 M{$\Sun$}yr-1 for brown dwarfs. Since the ability to measure an accretion rate from excess Balmer continuum emission depends on the contrast between excess continuum emission and the underlying photosphere, for objects with earlier spectral types the upper limit on accretion rate is much higher. Absolute uncertainties in our accretion rate measurements of {$\sim$}3--5 include uncertainty in accretion models, brown dwarf masses, and distance. The accretion rate of 2 {\texttimes} 10-12 M{$\Sun$} yr-1 onto 2MASS J12073347-3932540 is within 15\% of two previous measurements, despite large changes in the H{$\alpha$} flux.},

Unfortunately, the underlying mathematics describing stellar mass fractions and stellar elemental abundances is difficult to parse, is fragmented across the literature, and contains vexing omissions that makes any calculation far from trivial, especially for nonexperts. In this treatise, we present a clear mathematical formalism and clarification of inherent assumptions and normalizations within stellar composition measurements, which facilitates the conversion from stellar mass fractions to elemental abundances to molar ratios, including error propagation. We also provide an example case study of HIP 544 to further illustrate the provided equations. Given the important chemical association between stars, as well as the interdisciplinary relationship between stars and their planets, it is vital that stellar mass fractions and abundance data be more transparent and accessible to people within different subfields and scientific disciplines.},

Now that a number of exoplanets have measured C/O ratios, it is possible to examine this diagnostic at a population level. Here, we present an analysis of currently measured C/O ratios of directly imaged and transit/eclipse planets. First, we derive atmospheric parameters for the substellar companion HD 284149 AB b using data taken with the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph at the W.M. Keck Observatory and report two non-detections from our ongoing imaging spectroscopy survey with Keck/OSIRIS.

We also derive the first dynamical mass estimate for HD 284149 AB b, finding a mass of {$\sim$}28               M               Jup               .

  abstract = {We present the atmospheric characterization of the substellar companion HD 19467 B as part of the pioneering JWST GTO program to obtain moderate resolution spectra (R{$\sim$}2,700, 3-5{\textmu}m) of a highcontrast companion with the NIRSpec IFU. HD 19467 B is an old, {$\sim$}9 Gyr, companion to a Solar-type star with multiple measured dynamical masses. The spectra show detections of CO, CO2, CH4, and H2O. We forward model the spectra using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and atmospheric model grids to constrain the effective temperature and surface gravity. We then use NEWERAPHOENIX grids to constrain non-equilibrium chemistry parameterized by Kzz and explore molecular abundance ratios of the detected molecules. We find an effective temperature of 1103 K, with a probable range from 1000--1200 K, a surface gravity of 4.50 dex, with a range of 4.14--5.00, and deep vertical mixing, log10(Kzz), of 5.03, with a range of 5.00--5.44. All molecular mixing ratios are approximately Solar, leading to a C/O {$\sim$}0.55, which is expected from a T5.5 brown dwarf. Finally, we calculate an updated dynamical mass of HD 19467 B using newly derived NIRCam astrometry which we find to be 71.6+-54..36MJup, in agreement with the mass range we derive from evolutionary models, which we find to be 63-75 MJup.These observations demonstrate the excellent capabilities of the NIRSpec IFU to achieve detailed spectral characterization of substellar companions at high-contrast close to bright host stars, in this case at a separation of {$\sim$}1.6{$\prime\prime$}with a contrast of 10-4 in the 3-5 {\textmu}m range.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Angular differential imaging (ADI) and spectral differential imaging (SDI) are well-established high-contrast imaging techniques, but their application is challenging for companions at small angular separations from their host stars.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} The aim of this paper is to investigate to what extent adaptive-optics assisted, medium-resolution (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} {\textasciitilde} 5000) integral field spectrographs (IFS) can be used to directly detect the absorption of molecular species in the spectra of planets and substellar companions when these are not present in the spectrum of the star.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We analysed archival data of the \emph{{$\beta<$}i/{$>$} Pictoris system taken with the SINFONI integral field spectrograph located at ESO's Very Large Telescope, originally taken to image \emph{{$\beta<$}i/{$>$} Pictoris b using ADI techniques. At each spatial position in the field, a scaled instance of the stellar spectrum is subtracted from the data after which the residuals are cross-correlated with model spectra. The cross-correlation co-adds the individual absorption lines of the planet emission spectrum constructively, while this is not the case for (residual) telluric and stellar features.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Cross-correlation with CO and H\textsubscript{2{$<$}sub/{$>$}O models results in significant detections of \emph{{$\beta<$}i/{$>$} Pictoris b with signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns) of 13.7 and 16.4 respectively. Correlation with a \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$} = 1700 K BT-Settl model provides a detection with an S/N of 22.8. This in contrast to application of ADI, which barely reveals the planet. While the adaptive optics system only achieved modest Strehl ratios of 19--27\% leading to a raw contrast of 1:240 at the planet position, cross-correlation achieves a 3\emph{{$\sigma<$}i/{$>$} contrast limit of 2.7 {\texttimes} 10\textsuperscript{-5{$<$}sup/{$>$} in this 2.5 hr data set, a factor {\textasciitilde}40 below the raw noise level at an angular distance of 0.36{$\prime\prime$} from the star.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} Adaptive-optics assisted, medium-resolution IFS, such as SINFONI on the VLT and OSIRIS on the Keck Telescope, can be used for high-contrast imaging utilizing cross-correlation techniques for planets that are close to their star and embedded in speckle noise. We refer to this method as molecule mapping, and advocate its application to observations with future medium resolution instruments, in particular ERIS on the VLT, HARMONI on the ELT and NIRSpec, and MIRI on the JWST.}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a ``generative model'' for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is required if there are ``nuisance parameters'' to marginalize away.},

  abstract = {There are many uses for linear fitting; we consider here the interpolation and denoising of data, as when the goal is to fit a smooth, flexible function to a set of noisy data points. Investigators often choose a polynomial basis, or a Fourier basis, or wavelets, or something equally general. They also choose an order, or number of basis functions to fit, and (often) some kind of regularization. We discuss how this basis-function fitting is done, with ordinary least squares and extensions thereof. We emphasize that it can be valuable to choose far more parameters than data points, despite folk rules to the contrary: Suitably regularized models with enormous numbers of parameters generalize well and make good predictions for held-out data; over-fitting is not (mainly) a problem of having too many parameters. It is even possible to take the limit of infinite parameters, at which, if the basis and regularization are chosen correctly, the least-squares fit becomes the mean of a Gaussian process, or a kernel regression. We recommend cross-validation as a good empirical method for model selection (for example, setting the number of parameters and the form of the regularization), and jackknife resampling as a good empirical method for estimating the uncertainties of the predictions made by the model. We also give advice for building stable computational implementations.},

  abstract = {The JWST is ushering in a new era in remote sensing of exoplanetary atmospheres. Atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets can be highly sensitive to high-precision JWST data. It is, therefore, imperative to characterize the instruments and noise sources using early observations to enable robust characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres using JWST-quality spectra. This work is a step in that direction, focusing on the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) instrument mode, with a wavelength coverage of 0.6--2.8~\${\textbackslash}mu\$m and R {$\sim$} 700. Using a custom-built pipeline, JExoRES, we investigate key diagnostics of NIRISS SOSS with observations of two giant exoplanets, WASP-39~b and WASP-96~b, as case studies. We conduct a detailed evaluation of the different aspects of the data reduction and analysis, including sources of contamination, 1/f noise, and system properties such as limb darkening. The slitless nature of NIRISS SOSS makes it susceptible to contamination due to background sources. We present a method to model and correct for dispersed field stars that can significantly improve the accuracy of the observed spectra. In doing so, we also report an empirically determined throughput function for the instrument. We find significant correlated noise in the derived spectra, which may be attributed to 1/f noise, and discuss its implications for spectral binning. We quantify the covariance matrix that would enable the consideration of correlated noise in atmospheric retrievals. Finally, we conduct a comparative assessment of NIRISS SOSS spectra of WASP-39~b reported using different pipelines and highlight important lessons for exoplanet spectroscopy with JWST NIRISS.},

  abstract = {High-resolution spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful avenue for atmospheric remote sensing of exoplanets. Recently, ESO commissioned the CRIRES+ high-resolution infrared spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. CRIRES+ is a cross-dispersed spectrograph with high throughput and wide wavelength coverage across the nearinfrared (0.95--5.3 {$\mu$}m), designed to be particularly suited for atmospheric characterization of exoplanets. In this work, we report early insights into the performance of CRIRES+ for exoplanet spectroscopy and conduct a detailed assessment of the data reduction procedure. Because of the novelty of the instrument, we perform two independent data reduction strategies using the official CR2RES pipeline and our new custom-built ExoRES pipeline. Using science verification observations we find that the spectral resolving power of CRIRES+ can reach R  100,000 for optimal observing conditions. Similarly, we find the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to be consistent with expected and empirical estimates for the observations considered. As a case study, we perform the first application of CRIRES+ to the atmospheric characterization of an exoplanet---the ultrahot Jupiter MASCARA-1 b. We detect CO and H2O in the atmosphere of MASCARA-1 b at a S/N of 12.9 and 5.3, respectively, and a temperature inversion revealed through the CO and H2O emission lines, the first for an exoplanet. We find a combined S/N of 13.8 for CO and H2O together, with a preference for lower H2O abundance compared to CO. Our findings demonstrate the scientific potential of CRIRES+ and highlight the excellent opportunity for highresolution atmospheric spectroscopy of diverse exoplanets.},

  abstract = {Context: Ages, metallicities, space velocities, and Galactic orbits of stars in the Solar neighbourhood are fundamental observational constraints on models of galactic disk evolution. Understanding and minimising systematic errors and sample selection biases in the data is crucial for their interpretation. Aims: We aim to consolidate the calibrations of uvby{$\beta$} photometry into T\_eff, [Fe/H], distance, and age for F and G stars and rediscuss the results of the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (Nordstr{\"o}m et al. 2004; GCS) in terms of the evolution of the disk. Methods: We use recent V-K photometry, angular diameters, high-resolution spectroscopy, Hipparcos parallaxes, and extensive numerical simulations to re-examine and verify the temperature, metallicity, distance, and reddening calibrations for the uvby{$\beta$} system. We also highlight the selection effects inherent in the apparent-magnitude limited GCS sample. Results: We substantially improve the T\_eff and [Fe/H] calibrations for early F stars, where spectroscopic temperatures have large systematic errors. A slight offset of the GCS photometry and the non-standard helium abundance of the Hyades invalidate its use for checking metallicity or age scales; however, the distances, reddenings, metallicities, and age scale for GCS field stars require minor corrections only. Our recomputed ages are in excellent agreement with the independent determinations by Takeda et al. (2007), indicating that isochrone ages can now be reliably determined. Conclusions: The revised G-dwarf metallicity distribution remains incompatible with closed-box models, and the age-metallicity relation for the thin disk remains almost flat, with large and real scatter at all ages ({$\sigma\_$}intrinsic = 0.20 dex). Dynamical heating of the thin disk continues throughout its life; specific in-plane dynamical effects dominate the evolution of the U and V velocities, while the W velocities remain random at all ages. When assigning thick and thin-disk membership for stars from kinematic criteria, parameters for the oldest stars should be used to characterise the thin disk.

  abstract = {Brown dwarf spectra offer vital testbeds for our understanding of the chemical and physical processes that sculpt substellar atmospheres. Recently, atmospheric retrieval approaches have been successfully applied to low-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 100) spectra of L, T, and Y dwarfs, yielding constraints on the chemical abundances and temperature structures of these atmospheres. Medium-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 103) spectra of brown dwarfs offer additional insight, as molecular features are more easily disentangled and the thermal structure of the upper atmosphere is better probed. We present results from a GPU-based retrieval analysis of a high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 6000) FIRE spectrum from 0.85 to 2.5 {$\mu$}m of the T9 dwarf UGPS J072227.51-054031.2. At 60{\texttimes} higher spectral resolution than previous brown dwarf retrievals, a number of novel challenges arise. We examine the effect of different opacity sources, in particular for CH4. Furthermore, we find that flaws in the data like errors from order stitching can bias our constraints. We compare these retrieval results to those for an R {\textasciitilde} 100 spectrum of the same object, revealing how constraints on atmospheric abundances and temperatures improve by an order of magnitude or more with increased spectral resolution. In particular, we can constrain the abundance of H2S, which is undetectable at lower spectral resolution. While these medium-resolution retrievals offer the potential of precise, stellar-like constraints on atmospheric abundances ({\textasciitilde}0.02 dex), our retrieved radius is unphysically small ( \$R=\{0.50\}\_\{-0.01\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.01\}\$ R Jup), indicating shortcomings with our modeling framework. This work is an initial investigation into brown dwarf retrievals at medium spectral resolution, offering guidance for future ground-based studies and JWST observations.},

  abstract = {GQ Lup B is one of the few substellar companions with a detected cicumplanetary disk, or CPD. Observations of the CPD suggest the presence of a cavity, possibly formed by an exo-satellite. Using the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC), a high contrast imaging suite that feeds a high resolution spectrograph (1.9-2.5 microns, R{$\sim$}35,000), we present the first dedicated radial velocity (RV) observations around a high-contrast, directly imaged substellar companion, GQ Lup B, to search for exo-satellites. Over 11 epochs, we find a best and median RV error of 400-1000 m/s, most likely limited by systematic fringing in the spectra due to transmissive optics within KPIC. With this RV precision, KPIC is sensitive to exomoons 0.6-2.8\% the mass of GQ Lup B ( {$\sim$} 30 MJup) at separations between the Roche limit and 65 RJup, or the extent of the cavity inferred within the CPD detected around GQ Lup B. Using simulations of HISPEC, a high resolution infrared spectrograph planned to debut at W.M. Keck Observatory in 2026, we estimate future exomoon sensitivity to increase by over an order of magnitude, providing sensitivity to less massive satellites potentially formed within the CPD itself. Additionally, we run simulations to estimate the amount of material that different masses of satellites could clear in a CPD to create the observed cavity. We find satellite-to-planet mass ratios of q {$>$} 2 {\texttimes} 10-4 can create observable cavities and report a maximum cavity size of {$\sim$} 51 RJup carved from a satellite.},

We discover P{$\alpha$} and Br{$\beta$} line emission and characterize flare continuum at wavelengths from 1--3.5 {$\mu$}m for the first time. Observed lines include H{$\alpha$}, P{$\alpha$}--P{$\epsilon$}, Br{$\beta$}, He i {$\lambda$}0.7062 {$\mu$}m, two Ca ii infrared triplet (IRT) lines, and the He i IRT. We observe a reversed Paschen decrement from P{$\alpha$}--P{$\gamma$} alongside changes in the light-curve shapes of these lines. The continuum of all four flares is well described by blackbody emission with an effective temperature below 5300 K, lower than the temperatures typically observed at optical wavelengths. The 0.6--1 {$\mu$}m spectra were convolved with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) response, enabling us to measure the flare rate of TRAPPIST-1 in the TESS bandpass. We find flares of 1030 erg, large enough to impact transit spectra occur at a rate of flare day-1, {$\sim$}10{\texttimes} higher than previous predictions from K2. We measure the amount of flare contamination at 2 {$\mu$}m for the TRAPPIST-1b and f transits to be 500 {\textpm} 450 and 2100 {\textpm} 400 ppm, respectively. We find up to 80\% of flare contamination can be removed, with mitigation most effective from 1.0--2.4 {$\mu$}m. These results suggest transits affected by flares may still be useful for atmospheric characterization efforts.},

All of the T dwarfs in our sample are thin-disk brown dwarfs. We confirm previously reported moving group associations for four T dwarfs. However, the lack of spectral indicators of youth in two of these sources suggests that these are chance alignments. We confirm two previously unresolved binary candidates, the T0+T4.5 2MASS J11061197+2754225 and the L7+T3.5 2MASS J21265916+7617440, with orbital periods of 4 and 12 yr, respectively. We find a kinematic age of 3.5 {\textpm} 0.3 Gyr for local T dwarfs, consistent with nearby late M dwarfs (4.1 {\textpm} 0.3 Gyr). Removal of thick-disk L dwarfs in the local ultracool dwarf sample gives a similar age for L dwarfs (4.2 {\textpm} 0.3 Gyr), largely resolving the local L dwarf age anomaly. The kinematic ages of local late M, L, and T dwarfs can be accurately reproduced with population simulations incorporating standard assumptions of the mass function, star formation rate, and brown dwarf evolutionary models. A kinematic dispersion break is found at the L4-L6 subtypes, likely reflecting the terminus of the stellar main sequence. We provide a compilation of precise radial velocities for 172 late M, L, and T dwarfs within {\textasciitilde}20 pc of the Sun.},

We assume that the average viscosity can be represented by a critical Reynolds number in a geometrically thin disk and solve the structure and radiative transfer equations for a number of disk rings in the vertical direction. The combination of these rings provides the total disk structure and spectrum. Since the warm inner regions of protoplanetary disks show a rich molecular spectrum, they are well suited for a spectral analysis with our models.

  abstract = {Giant exoplanets located {$>$}1 au away from their parent stars have atmospheric environments cold enough for water or ammonia clouds. We have developed a new equilibrium cloud and reflected-light spectrum model, ExoREL, for widely separated giant exoplanets. The model includes the dissolution of ammonia in liquid-water cloud droplets, an effect studied for the first time for exoplanets. While preserving the causal relationship between temperature and cloud condensation, ExoREL is simple and fast to enable efficient exploration of parameter space. Using the model, we find that the mixing ratio of methane and the cloud top pressure of a giant exoplanet can be uniquely determined from a single observation of its reflected-light spectrum at wavelengths less than 1 {$\mu$}m if it has a cloud deck deeper than {$\sim$}0.3 bar. This measurement is enabled by the weak and strong bands of methane and requires a signal-to-noise ratio of 20. The cloud pressure, once derived, provides information about the internal heat flux of the planet. Importantly, we find that for a low, Uranus-like internal heat flux, the planet can have a deep liquidwater cloud, which will sequester ammonia and prevent the formation of the ammonia cloud that would otherwise be the uppermost cloud layer. This newly identified phenomenon causes a strong sensitivity of the cloud top pressure to the internal heat flux. Reflected-light spectroscopy from future direct-imaging missions should therefore not only measure the atmospheric abundances but also characterize the thermal evolution of giant exoplanets.},

Jansky Very Large Array, we have imaged the massive protocluster NGC 6334 I(N) at high angular resolution (0.{${''}$}5 {$\sim$} 650 AU) from 6 cm to 0.87 mm, detecting 18 new compact continuum sources. Three of the new sources are coincident with previously identified H2O masers. Together with the previously known sources, these data bring the number of likely protocluster members to 25 for a protostellar density of {$\sim$}700 pc-3. Our preliminary measurement of the Q-parameter of the minimum spanning tree is 0.82---close to the value for a uniform volume distribution. All of the (nine) sources with detections at multiple frequencies have spectral energy distributions consistent with dust emission, and two (SMA 1b and SMA 4) also have long wavelength emission consistent with a central hypercompact H ii region. Thermal spectral line emission, including CH3CN, is detected in six sources: LTE model fitting of CH3CN (J = 12--11) yields temperatures of 72--373 K, confirming the presence of multiple hot cores. The fitted LSR velocities range from -3.3 to -7.0 km s-1, with an unbiased mean square deviation of 2.05 km s-1, implying a protocluster dynamical mass of 410 {\textpm} 260 M{$\Sun$}. From analysis of a wide range of hot core molecules, the kinematics of SMA 1b are consistent with a rotating, infalling Keplerian disk of diameter 800 AU and enclosed mass of 10--30 M{$\Sun$} that is perpendicular (within 1{$^\circ$}) to the large-scale bipolar outflow axis. A companion to SMA 1b at a projected separation of 0.{${''}$}45 (590 AU; SMA 1d), which shows no evidence of spectral line emission, is also confirmed.

To understand the 12C/13C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the 12C/13C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH3OH) are slightly enriched in 13C compared to the local ISM (by {$\sim$} 10 \%), while those from C and C+ are depleted in 13C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ({$>$} 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The 12C/13C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in 13C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H2O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H2CO ice or C2O ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form 13C-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate 13C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the 12C/13C ratio of COMs.},

The gas kinematics toward MM 1a probed via CH3CN trace a variety of scales. The lower energy J = 12--11 K = 3 line traces extended, rotating gas within the outflow cavity, while the v8 = 1 line shows a clearly resolved Keplerian rotation signature. Analysis of the gas kinematics and dust emission shows that the total enclosed mass in MM 1a is 40 {\textpm} 5 M{$\odot$} (where between 2.2 and 5.8 M{$\odot$} is attributed to the disk), while MM 1b is {$<$}0.6 M{$\odot$}.

There is an abundance of H2O absorption lines from the {$\nu$}1 and {$\nu$}3 vibrational bands at 2.7{$\mu$}m, from the {$\nu$}2 vibrational band at 6.1{$\mu$}m, and from pure rotational transitions near 10--13{$\mu$}m. Analysis of state-specific column densities derived from the resolved absorption features reveals that an isothermal absorbing slab model is incapable of explaining the relative depths of different absorption features. In particular, the strongest absorption features are much weaker than expected, indicating optical depth effects resulting from the absorbing gas being well mixed with the warm dust that serves as the ``background'' continuum source at all observed wavelengths. The velocity at which the strongest H2O absorption occurs coincides with the velocity centroid along the minor axis of the compact disk in Keplerian rotation recently observed in H2O emission with ALMA. We postulate that the warm regions of this dust disk dominate the continuum emission at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, and that H2O and several other molecules observed in absorption are probing this disk. Absorption line profiles are not symmetric, possibly indicating that the warm dust in the disk that produces the infrared continuum has a nonuniform distribution similar to the substructure observed in 1.3mm continuum emission.},

  abstract = {Previous attempts have been made to characterize the atmospheres of directly imaged planets at low resolution (R {$\sim$} 10--100 s), but the presence of clouds has often led to degeneracies in the retrieved atmospheric abundances with cloud opacity and temperature structure that bias retrieved compositions. In this study, we perform retrievals on the ultrayoung ({$\lessequivlnt$}5 Myr) directly imaged planet ROXs 42B b with both a downsampled low-resolution JHK-band spectrum from Gemini/NIFS and Keck/OSIRIS, and a high-resolution K-band spectrum from pre-upgrade Keck/NIRSPAO. Using the atmospheric retrieval framework of petitRADTRANS, we analyze both data sets individually and combined. We additionally fit for the stellar abundances and other physical properties of the host stars, a young M spectral type binary, using the SPHINX model grid. We find that the measured C/O, 0.50 {\textpm} 0.05, and metallicity, [Fe/H] = -0.67 {\textpm} 0.35, for ROXs 42B b from our high-resolution spectrum agree with those of its host stars within 1{$\sigma$}. The retrieved parameters from the high-resolution spectrum are also independent of our choice of cloud model. In contrast, the retrieved parameters from the low-resolution spectrum show strong degeneracies between the clouds and the retrieved metallicity and temperature structure. When we retrieve both data sets together, we find that these degeneracies are reduced but not eliminated, and the final results remain highly sensitive to cloud modeling choices. We conclude that high-resolution spectroscopy offers the most promising path for reliably determining atmospheric compositions of directly imaged companions independent of their cloud properties.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT We present CARMA observations of the thermal dust emission from the circumstellar disks around the young stars RY Tau and DG Tau at wavelengths of 1.3 mm and 2.8 mm. The angular resolution of the maps is as high as 0.15, or 20 AU at the distance of the Taurus cloud, which is a factor of 2 higher than has been achieved to date at these wavelengths. The unprecedented detail of the resulting disk images enables us to address three important questions related to the formation of planets. (1) What is the radial distribution of the circumstellar dust? (2) Does the dust emission show any indication of gaps that might signify the presence of (proto-)planets? (3) Do the dust properties depend on the orbital radius? We find that modeling the disk surface density in terms of either a classical power law or the similarity solution for viscous disk evolution reproduces the observations well. Both models constrain the surface density between 15 and 50 AU to within 30\% for a given dust opacity. Outside this range, the densities inferred from the two models differ by almost an order of magnitude. The 1.3 mm image from RY Tau shows two peaks separated by 0.2 with a decline in the dust emission toward the stellar position, which is significant at about 2{$\sigma$} --4{$\sigma$} . For both RY Tau and DG Tau, the dust emission at radii larger than 15 AU displays no significant deviation from an unperturbed viscous disk model. In particular, no radial gaps in the dust distribution are detected. Under reasonable assumptions, we exclude the presence of planets more massive than 5 MJ orbiting either star at distances between about 10 and 60 AU, unless such a planet is so young that there has been insufficient time to open a gap in the disk surface density. The radial variation of the dust opacity slope, {$\beta$}, was investigated by comparing the 1.3 mm and 2.8 mm observations. We find mean values of {$\beta$} of 0.5 and 0.7 for DG Tau and RY Tau, respectively. Variations in {$\beta$} are smaller than {$\Delta\beta$} = 0.7 between 20 and 70 AU. These results confirm that the circumstellar dust throughout these disks differs significantly from dust in the interstellar medium.},

We present elemental abundances of 13 M dwarfs (2900 {$<$} T eff {$<$} 3500 K) observed in the Subaru/IRD planet search project. They are mid- to late-M dwarfs whose abundance of individual elements has not been well studied. We use the high-resolution ({$\sim$}70,000) near-infrared (970--1750 nm) spectra to measure the abundances of Na, Mg, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Sr by the line-by-line analysis based on model atmospheres, with typical errors ranging from 0.2 dex for [Fe/H] to 0.3--0.4 dex for other [X/H]. We measure radial velocities from the spectra and combine them with Gaia astrometry to calculate the Galactocentric space velocities UVW. The resulting [Fe/H] values agree with previous estimates based on medium-resolution K-band spectroscopy, showing a wide distribution of metallicity (-0.6 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} +0.4). The abundance ratios of individual elements [X/Fe] are generally aligned with the solar values in all targets. While the [X/Fe] distributions are comparable to those of nearby FGK stars, most of which belong to the thin-disk population, the most metal-poor object, GJ 699, could be a thick-disk star. The UVW velocities also support this. The results raise the prospect that near-infrared spectra of M dwarfs obtained in the planet search projects can be used to grasp the trend of elemental abundances and the Galactic stellar population of nearby M dwarfs.},

Near-infrared coronagraphic observations with CIAO on the Subaru Telescope have revealed DH Tau B with H {$\frac{1}{4}$} 15 mag located 2B3 (330 AU) away from the primary, DH Tau A. Comparing its position with a Hubble Space Telescope archive image, we confirmed that DH Tau A and B share a common proper motion, suggesting that they are physically associated with each other. The near-infrared color of DH Tau B is consistent with those of young stellar objects. The near-infrared spectra of DH Tau B show deep water absorption bands, a strong K i absorption line, and a moderate Na i absorption line. We derived its effective temperature and surface gravity of TeA {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2700 2800 K and log g {$\frac{1}{4}$} 4:0 4:5, respectively, by comparing the observed spectra with synthesized spectra of low-mass objects. The location of DH Tau B on the H-R diagram gives its mass of 30MJ --50MJ.},

  abstract = {About 70\%--80\% of stars in our solar and Galactic neighborhood are M dwarfs. They span a range of low masses and temperatures relative to solar-type stars, facilitating molecule formation throughout their atmospheres. Standard stellar atmosphere models primarily designed for FGK stars face challenges when characterizing broadband molecular features in spectra of cool stars. Here, we introduce SPHINX---a new 1D self-consistent radiative--convective thermochemical equilibrium chemistry model grid of atmospheres and spectra for M dwarfs in low resolution (R {$\sim$} 250). We incorporate the latest precomputed absorption cross sections with pressure broadening for key molecules dominant in late-K, early/main-sequence-M stars. We then validate our grid models by determining fundamental properties (Teff, log g, [M/H], radius, and C/O) for 10 benchmark M+G binary stars with known host metallicities and 10 M dwarfs with interferometrically measured angular diameters. Incorporating the Gaussian process inference tool Starfish, we account for correlated and systematic noise in low-resolution (spectral stitching of SpeX, SNIFS, and STIS) observations and derive robust estimates of fundamental M-dwarf atmospheric parameters. Additionally, we assess the influence of photospheric heterogeneity on inferred [M/H] and find that it could explain some deviations from observations. We also probe whether the adopted convective mixing length parameter influences inferred radii, effective temperature, and [M/H] and again find that may explain discrepancies between interferometric observations and model-derived parameters for cooler M dwarfs. Mainly, we show the unique strength in leveraging broadband molecular absorption features occurring in lowresolution M dwarf spectra and demonstrate the ability to improve constraints on fundamental properties of exoplanet hosts and brown-dwarf companions.},

(2024) to determine the effective temperature and chemical abundances of 31 slowly-rotating solar neighborhood M dwarfs (M1-M5) using high-resolution spectra from CFHT/SPIRou. This group includes 10 M dwarfs in binary systems with FGK primaries of known metallicity from optical measurements. By testing our \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ method on various synthetic models, we find a consistent inherent synthetic uncertainty of \${\textbackslash}sim\$10 K at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 100. Additionally, we find that our results align with interferometric measurements, showing a consistent residual of \$-\$29 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 31 K. Taking the inherent uncertainties into account, we infer the \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ values of our targets and find an excellent agreement with previous optical and NIR studies. Our high-resolution chemical analysis examines hundreds of absorption lines using \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ minimization using PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. We present elemental abundances for up to 10 different elements, including refractory elements such as Si, Mg, and Fe, which are important for modelling the interior structure of exoplanets. In binary systems, we find an average [Fe/H] of \$-\$0.15 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.08 for M dwarfs, marginally lower than the reported metallicity of \$-\$0.06 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.18 for the FGK primaries from Mann et al. (2013a). We also observe slightly sub-solar chemistry for various elements in our non-binary M dwarfs, most notably for O, C, and K abundances. In particular, we find an average metallicity of \$-\$0.11 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.16 lower but still consistent with the typical solar metallicity of FGK stars (e.g. [Fe/H] = 0.04 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.20 from Brewer et al. 2016). This study highlights significant discrepancies in various major M dwarf surveys likely related to differences in the methodologies employed.},

This paper presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of Barnard's star that compares an exceptionally high-quality (signal-to-noise ratio of \${$>\$$}2500 in the \$H\$ band), high-resolution NIR spectrum taken with CFHT/SPIRou to PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. The observed spectrum shows thousands of lines not identified in the models with a similar large number of lines present in the model but not in the observed data. We also identify several other caveats such as continuum mismatch, unresolved contamination and spectral lines significantly shifted from their expected wavelengths, all of these can be a source of bias for abundance determination. Out of \${$>$}10{\textasciicircum}4\$ observed lines in the NIR that could be used for chemical spectroscopy, we identify a short list of a few hundred lines that are reliable. We present a novel method for determining the effective temperature and overall metallicity of slowly-rotating M dwarfs that uses several groups of lines as opposed to bulk spectral fitting methods. With this method, we infer \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ = 3231 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 21 K for Barnard's star, consistent with the value of 3238 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 11 K inferred from the interferometric method. We also provide abundance measurements of 15 different elements for Barnard's star, including the abundances of four elements (K, O, Y, Th) never reported before for this star. This work emphasizes the need to improve current atmosphere models to fully exploit the NIR domain for chemical spectroscopy analysis.},

  abstract = {We examine the observational appearance of partial gaps being opened by planets in protoplanetary disks, considering the effects of the inclination relative to the line of sight. We model the disks with static {$\alpha$}-models with detailed radiative transfer, parameterizing the shape and size of the partially cleared gaps based on the results of hydrodynamic simulations. As in previous work, starlight falling across the gap leads to high surface brightness contrasts. The gap's trough is darkened by both shadowing and cooling, relative to the uninterrupted disk. The gap's outer wall is brightened by direct illumination and also by heating, which puffs it up so that it intercepts more starlight. In this paper, we examine the effects of inclination on resolved images of disks with and without gaps at a wide range of wavelengths. The scattering surface's offset from the disk midplane creates a brightness asymmetry along the axis of inclination, making the disk's near side appear brighter than the far side in scattered light. Finite disk thickness also causes the projected distances of equidistant points on the disk surface to be smaller on the near side of the disk as compared to the far side. Consequently, the gap shoulder on the near side of the disk should appear brighter and closer to the star than on the far side. However, if the angular resolution of the observation is coarser than the width of the brightened gap shoulder, then the gap shoulder on the far side may appear brighter because of its larger apparent size. We present a formula to recover the scale height and inclination angle of an imaged disk using simple geometric arguments and measuring disk asymmetries. Resolved images of circumstellar disks have revealed clearings and gaps, such as the transitional disk in LkCa 15. Models created using our synthetic imaging attempting to match the morphology of observed scattered light images of LkCa 15 indicate that the H-band flux deficit in the inner {$\sim$}0.{${''}$}5 of the disk can be explained with a planet if mass is greater than 0.5 Jupiter mass.},

An a posteriori detection in the 11-year old data would provide a useful astrometric data point for the very long-period ({$\sim$}1000 yr) orbit of the GQ Lup system. However, the data is severely contaminated by speckle noise at the given projected separation, which decreases the confidence of the detection. Still, from the data we can conclude that GQ Lup B is not an unrelated background source, but instead a physical companion to GQ Lup A. We present here the reduction and analysis of the ComeOn+ images, as well as the results. We also discuss the nature of the companion based on data and models available in the scientific literature and examine claims made regarding the classification of the object as a planet.},

Using an observational form of the HRD with MG representing luminosity and GBP - GRP representing temperature, the gap presents a diagonal feature that dips toward lower luminosities at redder colors. The gap is seen in samples extracted from DR2 with various distances, and is not unique to the Gaia photometry---it also appears when using near-IR (NIR) photometry (J - Ks versus ). The gap is very narrow ({$\sim$}0.05 mag) and is near the luminosity--temperature regime where M dwarf stars transition from partially to fully convective, i.e., near spectral type M3.0V. This gap provides a new feature in the HRD that hints at an underlying astrophysical cause, and we propose that it is linked to the onset of full convection in M dwarfs.},

  abstract = {As part of a multifaceted program to investigate the origin and early evolution of substellar objects, we present high-resolution Keck optical spectra of 14 very low mass sources in the IC 348 young cluster and the Taurus star-forming cloud. All of our targets, which span a range of spectral types from M5 to M8, exhibit moderate to very strong H{$\alpha$} emission. In half of the IC 348 objects, the H{$\alpha$} profiles are broad and asymmetric, indicative of ongoing accretion. Of these, IC 348-355 (M8) is the lowest mass object to date to show accretion-like H{$\alpha$}. Three of our {\textasciitilde}M6 IC 348 targets with broad H{$\alpha$} also harbor broad O I (8446 {\AA}) and Ca II (8662 {\AA}) emission, and one shows broad He I (6678 {\AA}) emission; these features are usually seen in strongly accreting classical T Tauri stars. We find that in very low mass accretors, the H{$\alpha$} profile may be somewhat narrower than that in higher mass stars. We propose that low accretion rates combined with small infall velocities at very low masses can conspire to produce this effect. In the nonaccretors in our sample, H{$\alpha$} emission is commensurate with, or higher than, saturated levels in field M dwarfs of similar spectral type. Our results constitute the most compelling evidence to date that young brown dwarfs undergo a T Tauri-like accretion phase similar to that in stars. This is consistent with a common origin for most low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and isolated planetary mass objects.},

  abstract = {Among very metal-poor (VMP) stars, \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-poor VMP (\${\textbackslash}alpha\$PVMP) stars that have sub-solar values of \$\{{\textbackslash}rm [X/Fe]\}\$ for Mg and other \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ elements are rare and are thought to have been formed from gas polluted by Type 1a supernova (SN 1a). However, recent analyses indicate that pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) ejecta can also be a likely source. We perform a detailed analysis of 17 \${\textbackslash}alpha\$PVMP stars by considering six different scenarios relevant to the early Galaxy. We consider a single pair-instability supernova (PISN) and a single CCSN. Additionally, we consider the combination of ejecta from a CCSN with ejecta from another CCSN, a PISN, a near-Chandrasekhar mass (near-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Ch\}\}\$) SN 1a, and a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Ch\}\}\$) SN 1a. A clear signature can only be established for sub-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Ch\}\}\$ SN 1a with a near-smoking-gun signature in SDSSJ0018-0939 and a reasonably clear signature in ET0381. The majority (\$82{\textbackslash}\%\$) of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$PVMP stars can be explained by pure CCSN ejecta and do not require any SN 1a contribution. However, the combination of CCSN and sub-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Ch\}\}\$ SN 1a ejecta can also explain most (\$76{\textbackslash}\%\$) of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$PVMP stars. In contrast, the combination of ejecta from CCSN with near-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Ch\}\}\$ SN 1a and PISN can fit \$41{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$29{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the stars, respectively. The single PISN scenario is strongly ruled out for all stars. Our results indicate that \${\textbackslash}alpha\$PVMP stars are equally compatible with pure CCSN ejecta and a combination of CCSN and SN 1a ejecta, with sub-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Ch\}\}\$ SN 1a being roughly twice as frequent as near-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Ch\}\}\$ SN 1a.},

  abstract = {Observations carried out toward starless and prestellar cores have revealed that complex organic molecules are prevalent in these objects, but it is unclear what chemical processes are involved in their formation. Recently, it has been shown that complex organics are preferentially produced at an intermediate-density shell within the L1544 prestellar core at radial distances of {$\sim$}4000 au with respect to the core center. However, the spatial distribution of complex organics has only been inferred toward this core, and it remains unknown whether these species present a similar behavior in other cores. We report high-sensitivity observations carried out toward two positions in the L1498 starless core, the dust peak and a position located at a distance of {$\sim$}11,000 au from the center of the core where the emission of CH3OH peaks. Similarly to L1544, our observations reveal that small O-bearing molecules and N-bearing species are enhanced by factors of {$\sim$}4--14 toward the outer shell of L1498. However, unlike L1544, large O-bearing organics such as CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, or CH3OCHO are not detected within our sensitivity limits. For N-bearing organics, these species are more abundant toward the outer shell of the L1498 starless core than toward the one in L1544. We propose that the differences observed between O-bearing and N-bearing species in L1498 and L1544 are due to the different physical structure of these cores, which in turn is a consequence of their evolutionary stage, with L1498 being younger than L1544.},

  abstract = {The formation of cold gas giants similar to Jupiter and Saturn in orbit and mass is a great challenge for planetesimal-driven core accretion models because the core growth rates far from the star are low. Here we model the growth and migration of single protoplanets that accrete planetesimals and gas. We integrated the core growth rate using fits in the literature to N-body simulations, which provide the efficiency of accreting the planetesimals that a protoplanet migrates through. We take into account three constraints from the solar system and from protoplanetary discs: (1) the masses of the terrestrial planets and the comet reservoirs in Neptune's scattered disc and the Oort cloud are consistent with a primordial planetesimal population of a few Earth masses per AU, (2) evidence from the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt indicates that the characteristic planetesimal diameter is 100 km, and (3) observations of protoplanetary discs indicate that the dust is stirred by weak turbulence; this gas turbulence also excites the inclinations of planetesimals. Our nominal model built on these constraints results in maximum protoplanet masses of 0.1 Earth masses. Ignoring constraint (1) above, we show that even a planetesimal population of 1000 Earth masses, corresponding to 50 Earth masses per AU, fails to produce cold gas giants (although it successfully forms hot and warm gas giants). We conclude that a massive planetesimal reservoir is in itself insufficient to produce cold gas giants. The formation of cold gas giants by planetesimal accretion additionally requires that planetesimals are small and that the turbulent stirring is very weak, thereby violating all three above constraints.},

This review covers all aspects of planet formation by pebble accretion, from dust growth over planetesimal formation to the accretion of protoplanets and fully grown planets with gaseous envelopes. Pebbles are accreted at a very high rate---orders of magnitude higher than planetesimal accretion---and the rate decreases only slowly with distance from the central star. This allows planetary cores to start their growth in much more distant positions than their final orbits. The giant planets orbiting our Sun and other stars, including systems of wide-orbit exoplanets, can therefore be formed in complete consistency with planetary migration. We demonstrate how growth tracks of planetary mass versus semimajor axis can be obtained for all the major classes of planets by integrating a relatively simple set of governing equations.},

Material is accreted on to the protoplanet due to stirring by the turbulent surroundings. We speculate that the trend for prograde rotation among the largest asteroids is primordial and that protoplanets accreted 10--50 per cent of their mass from pebbles and rocks during the gaseous solar nebula phase. Our model also offers a possible explanation for the narrow range of spin periods observed among the largest bodies in the asteroid and trans-Neptunian belts, and predicts that 1000-km-scale Kuiper Belt objects that have not experienced giant impacts should preferentially spin in the prograde direction.},

We present data on both photospheric lines and emission lines, concentrating our discussion on the polarization properties of the He i emission lines at 5876 {\AA} and 6678 {\AA}. The He i lines in these CTTSs contain both narrow emission cores, believed to come from near the accretion shock region on these stars, and broad emission components which may come from either a wind or the large-scale magnetospheric accretion flow. We detect strong polarization in the narrow component of the two He i emission lines in both stars. We observe a maximum implied field strength of 6.05 {\textpm} 0.24 kG in the 5876 {\AA} line of GQ Lup, making it the star with the highest field strength measured in this line for a CTTS. We find field strengths in the two He i lines that are consistent with each other, in contrast to what has been reported in the literature on at least one star. We do not detect any polarization in the broad component of the He i lines on these stars, strengthening the conclusion that they form over a substantially different volume relative to the formation region of the narrow component of the He i lines.},

Accretion disk models constrained by existing stellar and accretion parameters yield testable predictions for K-band veiling. In the context of these models, we examine sources of IR emission from the disk. The importance of disk reprocessing of emission from the accretion shock as material strikes the stellar surface is shown. We then show that current models constrained by the most recent estimates of mass accretion have a difficult time reproducing many of our high-veiling results. We suggest that dust out of the plane of the accretion disk (possibly in the magnetospheric flow itself) may account for much of the emission missing in the models.},

Ground-based photometric and spectroscopic followup from different facilities, confirmed the substellar nature of TIC 4672985 b, a massive gas giant, in the transition between the super-Jupiters and brown-dwarfs mass regime. From the joint analysis we derived the following orbital parameters: P = 69.0480+-00..00000045 d, Mp = 12.74-+11..0011 MJ , Rp = 1.026+-00..006657 RJ and e = 0.018+-00..000044 . In addition, the RV time series revealed a significant trend at the {$\sim$} 350 m s-1 yr-1 level, which is indicative of the presence of a massive outer companion in the system. TIC 4672985 b is a unique example of a transiting substellar companion with a mass above the deuterium-burning limit, located beyond 0.1 AU and in a nearly circular orbit. These planetary properties are difficult to reproduce from canonical planet formation and evolution models.

Hubble Space Telescope observations separated by 1.73 years reveal counterclockwise orbital motion. Dynamical models of the interaction between the planet and the belt indicate that the planet's mass is at most three times that of Jupiter; a higher mass would lead to gravitational disruption of the belt, matching predictions of its location. The flux detected at 0.8 {$\mu$}m is also consistent with that of a planet with mass no greater than a few times that of Jupiter. The brightness at 0.6 {$\mu$}m and the lack of detection at longer wavelengths suggest that the detected flux may include starlight reflected off a circumplanetary disk, with dimension comparable to the orbits of the Galilean satellites.

Observations in six filters using NIRCam's round coronagraphic masks provide a high signal-to-noise detection of {$\beta$} Pic b and the archetypal debris disk around {$\beta$} Pic over a wavelength range of {$\sim$} 1.7--5 {\textmu}m. This paper focuses on the detection of {$\beta$} Pic b and other potential point sources in the NIRCam data, following a paper by Rebollido et al. which presented the NIRCam and MIRI view of the debris disk around {$\beta$} Pic. We develop and validate approaches for obtaining accurate photometry of planets in the presence of bright, complex circumstellar backgrounds. By simultaneously fitting the planet's PSF and a geometric model for the disk, we obtain planet photometry that is in good agreement with previous measurements from the ground. The NIRCam data supports the cloudy nature of {$\beta$} Pic b's atmosphere and the discrepancy between its mass as inferred from evolutionary models and the dynamical mass reported in the literature. We further identify five additional localized sources in the data, but all of them are found to be background stars or galaxies based on their color or spatial extent. We can rule out additional planets in the disk midplane above 1 MJup outward of 2 arcsec ({$\sim$} 40 au) and away from the disk midplane above 0.05 MJup outward of 4 arcsec ({$\sim$} 80 au).

  abstract = {The chemical evolution of the Universe is governed by the chemical yields from stars, which in turn are determined primarily by the initial stellar mass. Even stars as low as 0.9 M can, at low metallicity, contribute to the chemical evolution of elements. Stars less massive than about 10 M experience recurrent mixing events that can significantly change the surface composition of the envelope, with observed enrichments in carbon, nitrogen, fluorine, and heavy elements synthesized by the slow neutron capture process (the s-process). Low- and intermediate-mass stars release their nucleosynthesis products through stellar outflows or winds, in contrast to massive stars that explode as core-collapse supernovae. Here we review the stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis for single stars up to {$\sim$}10 M from the main sequence through to the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). We include a discussion of the main uncertainties that affect theoretical calculations and review the latest observational data, which are used to constrain uncertain details of the stellar models. We finish with a review of the stellar yields available for stars less massive than about 10 M and discuss efforts by various groups to address these issues and provide homogeneous yields for low- and intermediate-mass stars covering a broad range of metallicities.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In ``nonstandard'' statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

This model enables a fully Bayesian inference of the high-dispersion data to fit the ab initio line-by-line spectral computation to the observed spectrum by combining it with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in recent probabilistic programming languages. An open-source code, ExoJAX (https://github.com/HajimeKawahara/exojax), developed in this study, was written in Python using the GPU/TPU compatible package for automatic differentiation and accelerated linear algebra, JAX. We validated the model by comparing it with existing opacity calculators and a radiative transfer code and found reasonable agreements for the output. As a demonstration, we analyzed the high-dispersion spectrum of a nearby brown dwarf, Luhman 16 A, and found that a model including water, carbon monoxide, and H2/He collision-induced absorption was well fitted to the observed spectrum (R = 105 and 2.28--2.30 {$\mu$}m). As a result, we found that T0 = 1295-+3325 K at 1 bar and C/O = 0.62 {\textpm} 0.03, which is slightly higher than the solar value. This work demonstrates the potential of a full Bayesian analysis of brown dwarfs and exoplanets as observed by highdispersion spectrographs and also directly imaged exoplanets as observed by high-dispersion coronagraphy.},

  abstract = {Brown dwarfs provide a unique opportunity to study atmospheres and their physical and chemical processes with high precision, especially in temperature ranges relevant to exoplanets. In this study, we performed high-resolution (\$R {\textbackslash}sim 70,000\$) spectroscopy using Subaru/IRD of Gl 229 B, the first discovered T-type (T7.0p) brown dwarf, which orbits an M1V host star at a separation of 33 au. We conducted atmospheric retrieval on the reduced \$H\$-band spectrum using the high-resolution spectrum model compatible with automatic differentiation and GPU, ExoJAX. In contrast to previous retrieval studies on medium-resolution spectra, we obtained a C/O ratio consistent with that of the host star, aligning with the expected formation process for such a massive brown dwarf. Additionally, based on the strong constraint on temperature from the high-resolution spectrum and previously measured photometric magnitude, our analysis indicates that Gl 229 B is a binary, which was also proposed by Brandt et al. (2021). Finally, we validated current molecular line lists by leveraging the obtained high-precision, high-resolution spectrum of this warm (\${\textbackslash}sim 900\$ K) atmosphere. This study highlights the importance of observing companion brown dwarfs as benchmark objects for establishing characterization techniques for low-mass objects and enhancing our understanding of their atmospheres, given the wealth of available information and the relative ease of observation.},

The snow line distance changes weakly with stellar mass; thus, giant planets form over a wide range of spectral types. The probability that a given star has at least one gas giant increases linearly with stellar mass from 0.4 to 3 M{$\odot$}. Stars more massive than 3 M{$\odot$} evolve quickly to the main sequence, which pushes the snow line to 10-15 AU before protoplanets form and limits the range of disk masses that form giant planet cores. If the frequency of gas giants around solar mass stars is 6\%, we predict occurrence rates of 1\% for 0.4 M{$\odot$} stars and 10\% for 1.5 M{$\odot$} stars. This result is largely insensitive to our assumed model parameters. Finally, the movement of the snow line as stars gtrsim2.5 M{$\odot$} move to the main sequence may allow the ocean planets suggested by L{\'e}ger et al. to form without migration.},

  abstract = {Planets grow in rotating disks of dust and gas around forming stars, some of which can subsequently collide in giant impacts after the gas component is removed from the disk1--3. Monitoring programmes with the warm Spitzer mission have recorded substantial and rapid changes in mid-infrared output for several stars, interpreted as variations in the surface area of warm, dusty material ejected by planetary-scale collisions and heated by the central star: for example, NGC 2354--ID8 (refs.\,4,5), HD 166191 (ref.\,6) and V488 Persei7. Here we report combined observations of the young (about 300\,million years old), solar-like star ASASSN-21qj: an infrared brightening consistent with a blackbody temperature of 1,000\,Kelvin and a luminosity~that is 4~percent that of the star lasting for about 1,000\,days, partially overlapping in time with a complex and deep, wavelength-dependent optical eclipse that lasted for about 500\,days. The optical eclipse started 2.5\,years after the infrared brightening, implying an orbital period of at least that duration. These observations are consistent with a collision between two exoplanets of several to tens of Earth masses at 2--16\,astronomical units from the central star. Such an impact produces a hot, highly extended post-impact remnant with sufficient luminosity to explain the infrared observations. Transit of the impact debris, sheared by orbital motion into a long cloud, causes the subsequent complex eclipse of the host star.},

Their study is of prime interest to understand the physical and chemical conditions under which planet formation takes place. Only very few detections of planet candidates within these disks exist, and most of them are currently suspected to be disk features.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} In this context, the transition disk around the young star PDS 70 is of particular interest, due to its large gap identified in previous observations, indicative of ongoing planet formation. We aim to search for the presence of an embedded young planet and search for disk structures that may be the result of disk--planet interactions and other evolutionary processes.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We analyse new and archival near-infrared images of the transition disk PDS 70 obtained with the VLT/SPHERE, VLT/NaCo, and Gemini/NICI instruments in polarimetric differential imaging and angular differential imaging modes.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We detect a point source within the gap of the disk at about 195 mas ({\textasciitilde}22 au) projected separation. The detection is confirmed at five different epochs, in three filter bands and using different instruments. The astrometry results in an object of bound nature, with high significance. The comparison of the measured magnitudes and colours to evolutionary tracks suggests that the detection is a companion of planetary mass. The luminosity of the detected object is consistent with that of an L-type dwarf, but its IR colours are redder, possibly indicating the presence of warm surrounding material. Further, we confirm the detection of a large gap of {\textasciitilde}54 au in size within the disk in our scattered light images, and detect a signal from an inner disk component. We find that its spatial extent is very likely smaller than {\textasciitilde}17 au in radius, and its position angle is consistent with that of the outer disk. The images of the outer disk show evidence of a complex azimuthal brightness distribution which is different at different wavelengths and may in part be explained by Rayleigh scattering from very small grains.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} The detection of a young protoplanet within the gap of the transition disk around PDS 70 opens the door to a so far observationally unexplored parameter space of planetary formation and evolution. Future observations of this system at different wavelengths and continuing astrometry will allow us to test theoretical predictions regarding planet--disk interactions, planetary atmospheres, and evolutionary models.}}}}}},

This work complements prior spectroscopic studies of silicate infrared emission from disks, which were focused on intermediate-mass stars, with observations of solar mass stars limited primarily to the 10  m region. The observed 10 and 20  m silicate feature strengths/shapes are consistent with source-to-source variations in grain size. A large fraction of the features are weak and flat, consistent with micron-sized grains indicating fast grain growth (from 0.1 to 1.0  m in radius). In addition, approximately half of the T Tauri star spectra show crystalline silicate features near 28 and 33  m, indicating significant processing when compared to interstellar grains. A few sources show large 10-to-20  m ratios and require even larger grains emitting at 20  m than at 10  m. This size difference may arise from the difference in the depth into the disk probed by the two silicate emission bands in disks where dust settling has occurred. The 10  m feature strength versus shape trend is not correlated with age or H  equivalent width, suggesting that some amount of turbulent mixing and regeneration of small grains is occurring. The strength versus shape trend is related to spectral type, however, with M stars showing significantly flatter 10  m features ( larger grain sizes) than A / B stars. The connection between spectral type and grain size is interpreted in terms of the variation in the silicate emission radius as a function of stellar luminosity, but could also be indicative of other spectral-type-dependent factors (e.g., X-rays, UV radiation, and stellar/disk winds).},

We compare the luminosity of the excess continuum emission in Class II and Class III YSOs and find that a number of Class III sources display a significant amount of excess flux in the near-infrared. We conclude that the mid-infrared SED slope, and therefore young stellar object classification, is a poor predictor of the amount of near-infrared veiling. If the veiling arises in thermal emission from dust, its presence implies a significant amount of remaining inner-disk ({$<$}1 au) material in these Class III sources. We also discuss the possibility that the veiling effects could result from massive photospheric spots, unresolved binary companions, or accretion emission. Six low-mass members of our sample contain a prominent feature in their H-band excess spectra that is consistent with veiling from cool photospheric spots.},

  abstract = {We present a machine learning package for the classification of periodic variable stars. Our package is intended to be general: it can classify any single band optical light curve comprising at least a few tens of observations covering durations from weeks to years with arbitrary time sampling. We use light curves of periodic variable stars taken from OGLE and EROS-2 to train the model. To make our classifier relatively survey-independent, it is trained on 16 features extracted from the light curves (e.g., period, skewness, Fourier amplitude ratio). The model classifies light curves into one of seven superclasses -- {$\delta$} Scuti, RR Lyrae, Cepheid, Type II Cepheid, eclipsing binary, long-period variable, non-variable -- as well as subclasses of these, such as ab, c, d, and e types for RR Lyraes. When trained to give only superclasses, our model achieves 0.98 for both recall and precision as measured on an independent validation dataset (on a scale of 0 to 1). When trained to give subclasses, it achieves 0.81 for both recall and precision. The majority of misclassifications of the subclass model is caused by confusion within a superclass rather than between superclasses. To assess classification performance of the subclass model, we applied it to the MACHO, LINEAR, and ASAS periodic variables, which gave recall/precision of 0.92/0.98, 0.89/0.96, and 0.84/0.88, respectively. We also applied the subclass model to Hipparcos periodic variable stars of many other variability types that do not exist in our training set, in order to examine how much those types degrade the classification performance of our target classes. In addition, we investigate how the performance varies with the number of data points and duration of observations. We find that recall and precision do not vary significantly if there are more than 80 data points and the duration is more than a few weeks.},

  abstract = {The discovery of epsilon Indi Ba, Bb, a binary brown dwarf system very close to the Sun, makes possible a concerted campaign to characterise the physical parameters of two T dwarfs. Recent observations suggest substellar atmospheric and evolutionary models may be inconsistent with observations, but there have been few conclusive tests to date. We therefore aim to characterise these benchmark brown dwarfs to place constraints on such models. We have obtained high angular resolution optical, near-infrared, and thermal-infrared imaging and medium-resolution (up to R{\textasciitilde}5000) spectroscopy of epsilon Indi Ba, Bb with the ESO VLT and present VRIzJHKL'M' broad-band photometry and 0.63--5.1 micron spectroscopy of the individual components. Furthermore, we use deep AO-imaging to place upper limits on the (model-dependent) mass of any further system members. We derive luminosities of log L/L\_sun = -4.699+/-0.017 and -5.232+/-0.020 for epsilon Indi Ba, Bb, respectively, and using the dynamical system mass and COND03 evolutionary models predict a system age of 3.7--4.3 Gyr, in excess of previous estimates and recent predictions from observations of these brown dwarfs. Moreover, the effective temperatures of 1352--1385 K and 976--1011 K predicted from the COND03 evolutionary models, for epsilon Indi Ba and Bb respectively, are in disagreement with those derived from the comparison of our data with the BT-Settl atmospheric models where we find effective temperatures of 1300--1340 K and 880--940 K, for epsilon Indi Ba and Bb respectively, with surface gravities of log g=5.25 and 5.50. Finally, we show that spectroscopically determined effective temperatures and surface gravities for ultra-cool dwarfs can lead to underestimated masses even where precise luminosity constraints are available.},

  abstract = {While following up L dwarf candidates selected photometrically from the Two Micron All Sky Survey, we uncovered an unusual object designated 2MASS J01415823-4633574. Its optical spectrum exhibits very strong bands of vanadium oxide but abnormally weak absorptions by titanium oxide, potassium, and sodium. Morphologically, such spectroscopic characteristics fall intermediate between old field early-L dwarfs [log(g){\textasciitilde}5] and very late M giants [log(g){\textasciitilde}0], leading us to favor low gravity as the explanation for the unique spectral signatures of this L dwarf. Such a low gravity can be explained only if this L dwarf is much lower in mass than a typical old field L dwarf of similar temperature and is still contracting to its final radius. These conditions imply a very young age. Further evidence of youth is found in the near-infrared spectrum, including a triangular-shaped H-band continuum, reminiscent of young brown dwarf candidates discovered in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Using the above information along with comparisons to brown dwarf atmospheric and interior models, our current best estimate is that this L dwarf has an age of 1-50 Myr and a mass of 6-25MJ. Although the lack of a lithium detection (pseudo-equivalent width {$<$}1 {\AA}) might appear to contradict other evidence of youth, we suggest that lithium becomes weaker at lower gravity like all other alkali lines and thus needs to be carefully considered before being used as a diagnostic of age or mass for objects in this regime. The location of 2MASS 0141-4633 on the sky coupled with a distance estimate of {\textasciitilde}35 pc and the above age estimate suggests that this object may be a brown dwarf member of either the 30 Myr old Tucana/Horologium association or the {\textasciitilde}12 Myr old {$\beta$} Pic moving group. Distance as determined through trigonometric parallax (underway) and a measure of the total space motion are needed to test this hypothesis. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

In the first 371 deg2 of actual 2MASS survey data, we have identified another 20 such objects spectroscopically confirmed using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) at the W. M. Keck Observatory. Because the TiO and VO bands, which dominate the far-optical portions of late-M spectra, disappear in these cooler dwarfs, we define a new spectral class "L" in which metallic oxides are replaced by metallic hydrides and neutral alkali metals as the major spectroscopic signatures. We establish classification indices and type all 25 L dwarfs. The 26th "post-M9.5" object---Gl 229B---is the prototype of a methane-dominated spectral class, which we propose as class "T." At least five of the 20 2MASS L dwarfs show the 6708 {\AA} lithium doublet at low resolution, the strongest having an equivalent width of 18.5 {\AA}. For objects this cool, the presence of lithium proves that they are substellar. Two other 2MASS objects appear to have lithium lines at the limit of our detectability, which if verified means that at least one-third of our L dwarfs are bona fide brown dwarfs. All of the 2MASS brown dwarfs discovered so far have J-Ks {$>$} 1.30. We have not yet, despite deliberately searching for them, found any brown dwarfs with colors resembling Gl 229B (J-Ks {$\approx$} -0.1).},

  abstract = {We present ground-based spectroscopic verification of 6 Y dwarfs (see also Cushing et al.), 89 T dwarfs, 8 L dwarfs, and 1 M dwarf identified by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Eighty of these are cold brown dwarfs with spectral types ⩾T6, six of which have been announced earlier by Mainzer et al. and Burgasser et al. We present color--color and color--type diagrams showing the locus of M, L, T, and Y dwarfs in WISE color space. Near-infrared and, in a few cases, optical spectra are presented for these discoveries. Near-infrared classifications as late as early Y are presented and objects with peculiar spectra are discussed. Using these new discoveries, we are also able to extend the optical T dwarf classification scheme from T8 to T9. After deriving an absolute WISE 4.6 {$\mu$}m (W2) magnitude versus spectral type relation, we estimate spectrophotometric distances to our discoveries. We also use available astrometric measurements to provide preliminary trigonometric parallaxes to four of our discoveries, which have types of L9 pec (red), T8, T9, and Y0; all of these lie within 10 pc of the Sun. The Y0 dwarf, WISE 1541-2250, is the closest at 2.8+1.3-0.6 pc; if this 2.8 pc value persists after continued monitoring, WISE 1541-2250 will become the seventh closest stellar system to the Sun. Another 10 objects, with types between T6 and {$>$}Y0, have spectrophotometric distance estimates also placing them within 10 pc. The closest of these, the T6 dwarf WISE 1506+7027, is believed to fall at a distance of {$\sim$}4.9 pc. WISE multi-epoch positions supplemented with positional info primarily from the Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera allow us to calculate proper motions and tangential velocities for roughly one-half of the new discoveries. This work represents the first step by WISE to complete a full-sky, volume-limited census of late-T and Y dwarfs. Using early results from this census, we present preliminary, lower limits to the space density of these objects and discuss constraints on both the functional form of the mass function and the low-mass limit of star formation.},

We create a census of objects within a Sun-centered sphere of 20 pc radius and check published literature to decompose each binary or higher-order system into its separate components. The result is a volume-limited census of {$\sim$}3600 individual star formation products useful in measuring the initial mass function across the stellar ({$<$}8M {$\odot$}) and substellar ({$\greaterequivlnt$}5M Jup) regimes. Comparing our resulting initial mass function to previous measurements shows good agreement above 0.8M {$\odot$} and a divergence at lower masses. Our 20 pc space densities are best fit with a quadripartite power law, , with long-established values of {$\alpha$} = 2.3 at high masses (0.55 {$<$} M {$<$} 8.00M {$\odot$}), and {$\alpha$} = 1.3 at intermediate masses (0.22 {$<$} M {$<$} 0.55M {$\odot$}), but at lower masses, we find {$\alpha$} = 0.25 for 0.05 {$<$} M {$<$} 0.22M {$\odot$}, and {$\alpha$} = 0.6 for 0.01 {$<$} M {$<$} 0.05M {$\odot$}.

For all types of atmospheres, we calculated in-transit absorption they would produce in the stellar Ly-{$\alpha$} line. We applied it to the out-of-transit Ly-{$\alpha$} observations of GJ 436 obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and compared the calculated in-transit absorption with observational uncertainties to determine if it would be detectable. To validate the model, we also used our method to simulate the deep absorption signature observed during the transit of GJ 436b and showed that our model is capable of reproducing the observations.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Cool astrophysical objects, such as (exo)planets, brown dwarfs, or asymptotic giant branch stars, can be strongly affected by condensation. Condensation not only directly affects the chemical composition of the gas phase by removing elements but the condensed material also influences other chemical and physical processes in these objects. This includes, for example, the formation of clouds in planetary atmospheres and brown dwarfs or the dust-driven winds of evolved stars. In this study, we introduce fastchem cond, a new version of the fastchem equilibrium chemistry code that adds a treatment of equilibrium condensation. Determining the equilibrium composition under the impact of condensation is complicated by the fact that the number of condensates that can exist in equilibrium with the gas phase is limited by a phase rule. However, this phase rule does not directly provide information as to which condensates are stable. A major advantage of fastchem cond is its ability to automatically select the set stable condensates satisfying the phase rule. Besides the normal equilibrium condensation, fastchem cond can also be used with the rainout approximation that is commonly employed in atmospheres of brown dwarfs or (exo)planets. fastchem cond is available as open-source code, released under the GNU General Public Licence 3 (GPLv3). In addition to the c++~code, fastchem cond also offers a python interface. Together with the code update, we also add about 290 liquid and solid condensate species to fastchem.},

  abstract = {We present new JHK photometry on the MKO-NIR system and JHK spectroscopy for a large sample of L and T dwarfs. Photometry has been obtained for 71 dwarfs, and spectroscopy for 56. The sample comprises newly identified very red objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and known dwarfs from the SDSS and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Spectral classification has been carried out using four previously defined indices from Geballe et al. that measure the strengths of the near infrared water and methane bands. We identify nine new L8--9.5 dwarfs and 14 new T dwarfs from SDSS, including the latest yet found by SDSS, the T7 dwarf SDSS J175805.46+463311.9. We classify 2MASS J04151954-0935066 as T9, the latest and coolest dwarf found to date. We combine the new results with our previously published data to produce a sample of 59 L dwarfs and 42 T dwarfs with imaging data on a single photometric system and with uniform spectroscopic classification. We compare the near-infrared colors and absolute magnitudes of brown dwarfs near the L--T transition with predictions made by models of the distribution and evolution of photospheric condensates. There is some scatter in the Geballe et al. spectral indices for L dwarfs, suggesting that these indices are probing different levels of the atmosphere and are affected by the location of the condensate cloud layer. The near-infrared colors of the L dwarfs also show scatter within a given spectral type, which is likely due to variations in the altitudes, spatial distributions, and thicknesses of the clouds. We have identified a small group of late-L dwarfs that are relatively blue for their spectral type and that have enhanced FeH, H2O, and K I absorption, possibly due to an unusually small amount of condensates. The scatter seen in the H-K color for late-T dwarfs can be reproduced by models with a range in surface gravity. The variation is probably due to the effect on the K-band flux of pressure-induced H2 opacity. The correlation of H-K color with gravity is supported by the observed strengths of the J-band K I doublet. Gravity is closely related to mass for field T dwarfs with ages greater than108 yr and the gravities implied by the H-K colors indicate that the T dwarfs in our sample have masses in the range 15--75MJupiter. One of the SDSS dwarfs, SDSS J111010.01+011613.1, is possibly a very low mass object, with log g {$\sim$} 4.2--4.5 and mass {$\sim$} 10--15MJupiter.},

  abstract = {Isotope ratios have opened a new window into the study of the details of stellar evolution, supernovae and galactic chemical evolution. We present the evolution of the isotope ratios of elemental abundances (from C to Zn) in the solar neighbourhood, bulge, halo and thick disc, using chemical evolution models with updated yields of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and core-collapse supernovae. The evolutionary history of each element is different owing to the effects of the initial progenitor mass and metallicity on element production. In the bulge and thick disc the star formation time-scale is shorter than in the solar neighbourhood, leading to higher [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios. Likewise, the smaller contribution from Type Ia supernovae in these regions leads to lower [Mn/Fe] ratios. Also in the bulge, the abundances of [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K, Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] are higher because of the effect of metallicity on element production from core-collapse supernovae. According to our predictions, it is possible to find metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] {$\greaterequivlnt-$}1) that formed in the early Universe as a result of rapid star formation. The chemical enrichment time-scale of the halo is longer than in the solar neighbourhood, and consequently the ratios of [(C, F)/Fe] and 12C/13C are higher owing to a significant contribution from low-mass AGB stars. While the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] ratios are the same as in the solar neighbourhood, the [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K, Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] ratios are predicted to be lower. Furthermore, we predict that isotope ratios such as 24Mg/25, 26Mg are larger because of the contribution from low-metallicity supernovae. Using isotopic ratios, it is possible to select stars that formed in a system with a low chemical enrichment efficiency such as the satellite galaxies that were accreted on to our own Milky Way Galaxy.},

This enables us to predict the origin of elements as a function of time and environment. In the solar neighborhood, we find that stars with initial masses of M \&gt; 30M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} can become failed supernovae if there is a significant contribution from hypernovae (HNe) at M {$\sim$} 20-50M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}. The contribution to GCE from super-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (with M {$\sim$} 8-10M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} at solar metallicity) is negligible, unless hybrid white dwarfs from low-mass super-AGB stars explode as so-called Type Iax supernovae, or high-mass super-AGB stars explode as electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe). Among neutron-capture elements, the observed abundances of the second (Ba) and third (Pb) peak elements are well reproduced with our updated yields of the slow neutron-capture process (s-process) from AGB stars. The first peak elements (Sr, Y, Zr) are sufficiently produced by ECSNe together with AGB stars. Neutron star mergers can produce rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) elements up to Th and U, but the timescales are too long to explain observations at low metallicities. The observed evolutionary trends, such as for Eu, can well be explained if {$\sim$}3\% of 25-50M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} HNe are magneto-rotational supernovae producing r-process elements. Along with the solar neighborhood, we also predict the evolutionary trends in the halo, bulge, and thick disk for future comparison with Galactic archeology surveys.},

Fortunately, advancements in the study of exoplanets and their atmospheres have come in the form of direct imaging---spatially resolving the planet from its parent star---which enables high-resolution spectroscopy of self-luminous planets in jovian-like orbits. Here, we present a spectrum with numerous, well-resolved molecular lines from both water and carbon monoxide from a massive planet orbiting less than 40 astronomical units from the star HR 8799. These data reveal the planet's chemical composition, atmospheric structure, and surface gravity, confirming that it is indeed a young planet. The spectral lines suggest an atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratio that is greater than that of the host star, providing hints about the planet's formation.},

We obtain volume number mixing ratios of the major gas-phase absorbers (H2O, CH4, CO, CO2, PH3, and H2S) that are 3--5{\texttimes} more precise than previous work that used HST spectra. We also find an order-ofmagnitude improvement in the precision of the retrieved thermal profile, a direct result of the broad wavelength coverage of the JWST data. We used the retrieved thermal profile and surface gravity to generate a grid of chemical forward models with varying metallicity, (C/O)atm, and strengths of vertical mixing as encapsulated by the eddy diffusion coefficient Kzz. Comparison of the retrieved abundances with this grid of models suggests that the deep atmosphere of WISE 0359-54 shows signs of vigorous vertical mixing with Kzz = 109 [cm2 s-1]. To test the sensitivity of these results to our 5-knot spline thermal profile model, we performed a second retrieval using the Madhusudhan \& Seager (2009) thermal profile model. While the results of the two retrievals generally agree well, we do find differences between the retrieved values of mass and volume number mixing ratio of H2S with fractional differences of the median values of -0.64 and -0.10, respectively. In addition, the 5-knot thermal profile is consistently warmer at pressure between 1 and 70 bar. Nevertheless, our results underscore the power that the broad-wavelength infrared spectra obtainable with the James Webb Space Telescope have to characterize the atmospheres of cool brown dwarfs.},

  abstract = {Young and directly imaged exoplanets offer critical tests of planet-formation models that are not matched by radial velocity surveys of mature stars. These targets have been extremely elusive to date, with no exoplanets younger than 10--20 Myr and only a handful of direct-imaged exoplanets at all ages. We report the direct-imaging discovery of a likely (proto)planet around the young ({$\sim$}2 Myr) solar analog LkCa 15, located inside a known gap in the protoplanetary disk (a ``transitional disk''). Our observations use non-redundant aperture masking interferometry at three epochs to reveal a faint and relatively blue point source (, K{$\prime$} - L{$\prime$} = 0.98 {\textpm} 0.22), flanked by approximately co-orbital emission that is red and resolved into at least two sources (, K{$\prime$} - L{$\prime$} = 2.7 {\textpm} 0.3; , K{$\prime$} - L{$\prime$} = 1.94 {\textpm} 0.16). We propose that the most likely geometry consists of a newly formed (proto)planet that is surrounded by dusty material. The nominal estimated mass is {$\sim$}6 MJup according to the 1 Myr hot-start models. However, we argue based on its luminosity, color, and the presence of circumplanetary material that the planet has likely been caught at its epoch of assembly, and hence this mass is an upper limit due to its extreme youth and flux contributed by accretion. The projected separations (71.9 {\textpm} 1.6 mas, 100.7 {\textpm} 1.9 mas, and 88.2 {\textpm} 1.8 mas) and deprojected orbital radii (16, 21, and 19 AU) correspond to the center of the disk gap, but are too close to the primary star for a circular orbit to account for the observed inner edge of the outer disk, so an alternative explanation (i.e., additional planets or an eccentric orbit) is likely required. This discovery is the first direct evidence that at least some transitional disks do indeed host newly formed (or forming) exoplanetary systems, and the observed properties provide crucial insight into the gas giant formation process.},

All three wide planetary-mass companions (PMCs) were reported as candidate companions in previous binary survey programs, but then were neglected for {$>$}10 yr. We therefore obtained followup observations that demonstrate that each candidate is comoving with its host star. Based on the absolute magnitudes, we infer masses (from hot-start evolutionary models) and projected separations of 10 {\textpm} 4 MJup and 330 {\textpm} 30 AU for FW Tau b, 16 {\textpm} 4 MJup and 210 {\textpm} 20 AU for ROXs 12, and 10 {\textpm} 4 MJup and 140 {\textpm} 10 AU for ROXs 42B b. We also present similar observations for 10 other candidates that show that they are unassociated field stars, as well as multicolor JHK{$\prime$}L{$\prime$} near-infrared photometry for our new PMCs and for five previously identified substellar or planetary-mass companions. The near-infrared photometry for our sample of eight known and new companions generally parallels the properties of free-floating, low-mass brown dwarfs in these star-forming regions. However, five of the seven objects with M {$<$} 30 MJup are redder in K{$\prime$} - L{$\prime$} than the distribution of young free-floating counterparts of similar J - K{$\prime$} color. We speculate that this distinction could indicate a structural difference in circumplanetary disks, perhaps tied to higher disk mass since at least two of the objects in our sample are known to be accreting more vigorously than typical free-floating counterparts.},

Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we obtained observations that allow us to characterize WISE0855s atmosphere focusing on vertical variation in the water steam abundance, measuring trace gas abundances and receiving bulk parameters for this cold object. We observed the ultra cool dwarf WISE0855 using the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS) onboard JWST at a spectral resolution of up to 3750. We combined the observation with published data from the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) G395M and PRISM modes yielding a spectrum ranging from 0.8 to 22 um. We apply atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS to measure atmospheric abundances, the pressure-temperature structure, radius and gravity of the brown dwarf. We also employ publicly available clear and cloudy self-consistent grid models to estimate bulk properties of the atmosphere such as the effective temperature, radius, gravity and metallicity. Atmospheric retrievals constrain a variable water abundance profile in the atmosphere, as predicted by equilibrium chemistry. We detect the 15NH3 isotopologue and infer a ratio of mass fraction of 14NH3/15NH3 = 332+63-43 for the clear retrieval. We measure the bolometric luminosity by integrating the presented spectrum and obtain a value of log(L/L\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) = -7.291+/-0.008. The detected water depletion indicates that water condenses out in the upper atmosphere due to the very low effective temperature of WISE0855. The height in the atmosphere where this occurs is covered by the MIRI/MRS data, and thus demonstrates the potential of MIRI to characterize cold gas giants atmospheres. Comparing the data to retrievals and self-consistent grid models, we do not detect signs for water ice clouds, although their spectral features have been predicted in previous studies.},

  abstract = {Methods. We have used ground-based observations of discrete spectral features in combination with Fabry-Perot etalon spectra to characterize the wavelength solution and spectral resolving power of the MRS. We present the methodology used to derive the MRS spectral characterization, which includes the precise wavelength coverage of each MRS sub-band, computation of the resolving power as a function of wavelength, and measuring slice-dependent spectral distortions. Results. The ground calibration of the MRS shows that it will cover the wavelength ranges from 4.9 to 28.3 {\textmu}m, divided in 12 overlapping spectral sub-bands. The resolving power is R 3500 in channel 1, R 3000 in channel 2, R 2500 in channel 3, and R 1500 in channel 4. The MRS spectral resolution optimizes the sensitivity for detection of spectral features with a velocity width of {$\sim$}100 km s-1 which is characteristic of most astronomical phenomena JWST aims to study in the mid-infrared. Based on the ground test data, the wavelength calibration accuracy is estimated to be below one-tenth of a pixel (0.1 nm at 5 {\textmu}m and 0.4 at 28 {\textmu}m), with small systematic shifts due to the target position within a slice for unresolved sources that have a maximum amplitude of about 0.25 spectral resolution elements. The absolute wavelength calibration is presently uncertain at the level of 0.35 nm at 5 {\textmu}m and 46 nm at 28 {\textmu}m, and it will be refined using in-flight commissioning observations. Conclusions. Based on ground test data, the MRS complies with the spectral requirements for both the R and wavelength accuracy for which it was designed. We also present the commissioning strategies and targets that will be followed to update the spectral characterization of the MRS.},

  abstract = {Methods. We have used ground-based observations of discrete spectral features in combination with Fabry-Perot etalon spectra to characterize the wavelength solution and spectral resolving power of the MRS. We present the methodology used to derive the MRS spectral characterization, which includes the precise wavelength coverage of each MRS sub-band, computation of the resolving power as a function of wavelength, and measuring slice-dependent spectral distortions. Results. The ground calibration of the MRS shows that it will cover the wavelength ranges from 4.9 to 28.3 {\textmu}m, divided in 12 overlapping spectral sub-bands. The resolving power is R 3500 in channel 1, R 3000 in channel 2, R 2500 in channel 3, and R 1500 in channel 4. The MRS spectral resolution optimizes the sensitivity for detection of spectral features with a velocity width of {$\sim$}100 km s-1 which is characteristic of most astronomical phenomena JWST aims to study in the mid-infrared. Based on the ground test data, the wavelength calibration accuracy is estimated to be below one-tenth of a pixel (0.1 nm at 5 {\textmu}m and 0.4 at 28 {\textmu}m), with small systematic shifts due to the target position within a slice for unresolved sources that have a maximum amplitude of about 0.25 spectral resolution elements. The absolute wavelength calibration is presently uncertain at the level of 0.35 nm at 5 {\textmu}m and 46 nm at 28 {\textmu}m, and it will be refined using in-flight commissioning observations. Conclusions. Based on ground test data, the MRS complies with the spectral requirements for both the R and wavelength accuracy for which it was designed. We also present the commissioning strategies and targets that will be followed to update the spectral characterization of the MRS.},

We developed analytical expressions to describe the performance of dual-field interferometry and integrated these with simulations of atmospheric wavefronts corrected by extreme Adaptive Optics. An analytical solution for optimal phase apodization was formulated to enhance starlight rejection when injected into a single-mode fibre. This framework was applied to determine the detectability of known exoplanets in reflected light across various wavelength bands for both the current VLTI and a proposed extended version. Results. Our results indicate that employing shorter wavelengths improves detectability, enabling at least seven Jupiter-mass exoplanets to be observed in the J band with current VLTI's baselines. Adding new baselines with lengths beyond 200 meters significantly enhances VLTI's capabilities, increasing the number of detectable exoplanets and revealing potential habitable zone candidates such as {$\tau$} Ceti e and Proxima Centauri b. Conclusions. To substantially improve the VLTI's exoplanet characterization capabilities, we recommend developing instrumentation at wavelengths shorter than 1 {\textmu}m, as well as the addition of a fifth Unit Telescope (UT5).},

The observations were obtained with the Altair adaptive optics system at the Gemini North telescope, and angular differential imaging was used to suppress the speckle noise of the central star. Typically, the observations are sensitive to angular separations beyond 0.5'' with 5 {$\sigma$} contrast sensitivities in magnitude difference at 1.6 {$\mu$}m of 9.5 at 0.5'', 12.9 at 1'', 15.0 at 2'', and 16.5 at 5''. These sensitivities are sufficient to detect planets more massive than 2 MJ with a projected separation in the range 40-200 AU around a typical target. Second-epoch observations of 48 stars with candidates (out of 54) have confirmed that all candidates are unrelated background stars. A detailed statistical analysis of the survey results is presented. Assuming a planet mass distribution dn/dm {$\propto$} m-1.2 and a semimajor-axis distribution dn/da {$\propto$} a-1, the 95\% credible upper limits on the fraction of stars with at least one planet of mass 0.5-13 MJ are 0.28 for the range 10-25 AU, 0.13 for 25-50 AU, and 0.093 for 50-250 AU; this result is weakly dependent on the semimajor-axis distribution power-law index. The 95\% credible interval for the fraction of stars with at least one brown dwarf companion having a semimajor axis in the range 25-250 AU is 0.019, irrespective of any assumption on the mass and semimajor-axis distributions. The observations made as part of this survey have resolved the stars HD 14802, HD 166181, and HD 213845 into binaries for the first time.},

However, no planets have been detected around this star so far. Aims: Our goal was to investigate the close environment of {$\beta$} Pic, searching for planetary companion(s). Methods: Deep adaptive-optics L'-band images of {$\beta$} Pic were recorded using the NaCo instrument at the Very Large Telescope. Results: A faint point-like signal is detected at a projected distance of {$\simeq$}8 AU from the star, within the northeastern extension of the dust disk. Various tests were made to rule out possible instrumental or atmospheric artefacts at a good confidence level. The probability of a foreground or background contaminant is extremely low, based in addition on the analysis of previous deep HST images. Its L'=11.2 apparent magnitude would indicate a typical temperature of {\textasciitilde}1500 K and a mass of {\textasciitilde}8 M\_Jup. If confirmed, it could explain the main morphological and dynamical peculiarities of the {$\beta$} Pic system. The present detection is unique among A-stars by the proximity of the resolved planet to its parent star. Its closeness and location inside the {$\beta$} Pic disk suggest a formation process by core accretion or disk instabilities rather than binary-like formation processes. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, ESO (runs 072.C-0624(B) and 60.A-9026(A)) and on observations made with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph onboard the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.},

  abstract = {The formation of planetary cores must proceed rapidly in order for the giant planets to accrete their gaseous envelopes before the dissipation of the protoplanetary gas disc ({$<\sim$}3 Myr). In orbits beyond 10 AU, direct accumulation of planetesimals by the cores is too slow. Fragments of planetesimals could be accreted faster, but planetesimals are likely too large for fragmentation to be efficient, and resonant trapping poses an additional hurdle. Here we instead investigate the accretion of small pebbles (mm-cm sizes) that are the natural outcome of an equilibrium between the growth and radial drift of particles. We construct a simplified analytical model of dust coagulation and pebble drift in the outer disc, between 5 AU and 100 AU, which gives the temporal evolution of the solid surface density and the dominant particle size. These two key quantities determine how core growth proceeds at various orbital distances. We find that pebble surface densities are sufficiently high to achieve the inside-out formation of planetary cores within the disc lifetime. The overall efficiency by which dust gets converted to planets can be high, close to 50\% for planetary architectures similar to the solar system. Growth by pebble accretion in the outer disc is sufficiently fast to overcome catastrophic type I migration of the cores. These results require protoplanetary discs with large radial extent ({$>\sim$}100 AU) and assume a low number of initial seed embryos. Our findings imply that protoplanetary discs with low disc masses, as expected around low-mass stars ({$<$}1 M ), or with sub-solar dust-to-gas ratios, do not easily form gas-giant planets (M {$>\sim$} 100 ME), but preferentially form Neptune-mass planets or smaller (M {$<\sim$} 10 ME). This is consistent with exoplanet surveys which show that gas giants are relatively uncommon around stars of low mass or low metallicity.},

  abstract = {Gas-giant planets, like Jupiter and Saturn, acquire massive gaseous envelopes during the approximately 3 Myr-long lifetimes of protoplanetary discs. In the core accretion scenario, the formation of a solid core of around ten Earth masses triggers a phase of rapid gas accretion. Previous 3D grid-based hydrodynamical simulations found that runaway gas accretion rates correspond to approximately 10 to 100 Jupiter masses per Myr. Such high accretion rates would result in all planets with larger than ten Earth-mass cores to form Jupiter-like planets, which is in clear contrast to the ice giants in the Solar System and the observed exoplanet population. In this work, we used 3D hydrodynamical simulations, that include radiative transfer, to model the growth of the envelope on planets with different masses. We find that gas flows rapidly through the outer part of the envelope, but this flow does not drive accretion. Instead, gas accretion is the result of quasi-static contraction of the inner envelope, which can be orders of magnitude smaller than the mass flow through the outer atmosphere. For planets smaller than Saturn, we measured moderate gas accretion rates that are below one Jupiter mass per Myr. Higher mass planets, however, accrete up to ten times faster and do not reveal a self-driven mechanism that can halt gas accretion. Therefore, the reason for the final masses of Saturn and Jupiter remains difficult to understand, unless their completion coincided with the dissipation of the solar nebula.},

  abstract = {The observed lifetimes of gaseous protoplanetary discs place strong constraints on gas and ice giant formation in the core accretion scenario. The approximately 10-Earth-mass solid core responsible for the attraction of the gaseous envelope has to form before gas dissipation in the protoplanetary disc is completed within 1--10 million years. Building up the core by collisions between km-sized planetesimals fails to meet this timescale constraint, especially at wide stellar separations. Nonetheless, gas-giant planets are detected by direct imaging at wide orbital distances. In this paper, we numerically study the growth of cores by the accretion of cm-sized pebbles loosely coupled to the gas. We measure the accretion rate onto seed masses ranging from a large planetesimal to a fully grown 10-Earth-mass core and test different particle sizes. The numerical results are in good agreement with our analytic expressions, indicating the existence of two accretion regimes, one set by the azimuthal and radial particle drift for the lower seed masses and the other, for higher masses, by the velocity at the edge of the Hill sphere. In the former, the optimally accreted particle size increases with core mass, while in the latter the optimal size is centimeters, independent of core mass. We discuss the implications for rapid core growth of gas-giant and ice-giant cores. We conclude that pebble accretion can resolve the long-standing core accretion timescale conflict. This requires a near-unity dust-to-gas ratio in the midplane, particle growth to mm and cm and the formation of massive planetesimals or low radial pressure support. The core growth timescale is shortened by a factor 30--1000 at 5 AU and by a factor 100--10 000 at 50 AU, compared to the gravitationally focused accretion of, respectively, low-scale-height planetesimal fragments or standard km-sized planetesimals.},

  abstract = {Ultra-hot Jupiters have dayside temperatures at which most molecules are expected to thermally dissociate. The dissociation of water vapour results in the production of the hydroxyl radical (OH). While OH absorption is easily observed in near-infrared spectra of M dwarfs, which have similar effective temperatures as ultra-hot Jupiters, it is often not considered when studying the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters. We use high-resolution spectroscopic observations of a transit of WASP-76b obtained using CARMENES to study the presence of OH. After validating the OH line list, we generate model transit spectra of WASP-76b with petitRADTRANS. The data are corrected for stellar and telluric contamination and cross-correlated with the model spectra. After combining all cross-correlation functions from the transit, a detection map is constructed. Constraints on the planet properties from the OH absorption are obtained from a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis. OH is detected in the atmosphere of WASP-76b with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 6.1. From the retrieval we obtain \$K\_p=232 {\textbackslash}pm 12\$ km/s and a blueshift of \$-13.2 {\textbackslash}pm 1.6\$ km/s, which are offset from the expected velocities. Considering the fast spin rotation of the planet, the blueshift is best explained with the signal predominantly originating from the evening terminator and the presence of a strong dayside-to-nightside wind. The increased \$K\_p\$ over its expected value (196.5 km/s) is, however, a bit puzzling. The signal is found to be broad, with a full width at half maximum of \$16.8{\textasciicircum}\{+4.6\}\_\{-4.0\}\$ km/s. The retrieval results in a weak constraint on the mean temperature of 2700-3700 K at the pressure range of the OH signal. We show that OH is readily observable in the transit spectra of ultra-hot Jupiters. Studying this molecule can provide insights into the molecular dissociation processes in the atmospheres of such planets.},

  abstract = {Context. High-resolution spectrographs fed by adaptive optics (AO) provide a unique opportunity to characterize directly imaged exoplanets. Observations with such instruments allow us to probe the atmospheric composition, spin rotation, and radial velocity of the planet, thereby helping to reveal information on its formation and migration history. The recent upgrade of the Cryogenic High-Resolution Infrared Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES+) at the VLT makes it a highly suitable instrument for characterizing directly imaged exoplanets. Aims: In this work, we report on observations of {$\beta$} Pictoris b with CRIRES+ and use them to constrain the planets atmospheric properties and update the estimation of its spin rotation. Methods: The data were reduced using the open-source pycrires package. We subsequently forward-modeled the stellar, planetary, and systematic contribution to the data to detect molecules in the planet's atmosphere. We also used atmospheric retrievals to provide new constraints on its atmosphere. Results: We confidently detected water and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere of {$\beta$} Pictoris b and retrieved a slightly sub-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio, which is in agreement with previous results. The interpretation is hampered by our limited knowledge of the C/O ratio of the host star. We also obtained a much improved constraint on its spin rotation of 19.9 {\textpm} 1.0 kms-1, which gives a rotation period of 8.7 {\textpm} 0.8 h, assuming no obliquity. We find that there is a degeneracy between the metallicity and clouds, but this has minimal impact on the retrieved C/O, {$\upsilon$} sin i, and radial velocity. Our results show that CRIRES+ is performing well and stands as a highly useful instrument for characterizing directly imaged planets. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under ESO programme 108.22HG.001.},

Angular differential imaging was used in the J and H bands to suppress the speckle noise from GQ Lup A; we show that this approach can provide improvements in signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) by a factor of 2--6 for companions located at subarcsecond separations. Based on high-quality observations and Global Astrometric lnterferometer for Astrophysics synthetic spectra, we estimate the companion effective temperature to Teff = 2400 {\textpm} 100 K, its gravity to log g = 4.0 {\textpm} 0.5, and its luminosity to log(L/L{$\Sun$}) = -2.47 {\textpm} 0.28. Comparisons with the predictions of the DUSTY evolutionary tracks allow us to constrain the mass of GQ Lup b to 8--60 MJup, most likely in the brown dwarf regime. Compared with the spectra published by Seifahrt and collaborators, our spectra of GQ Lup b are significantly redder (by 15\%--50\%) and do not show important Pa{$\beta$} emission.

  abstract = {The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a fully-automated, wide-field survey aimed at a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky. The transient survey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera installed on the 48 inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory; colors and light curves for detected transients are obtained with the automated Palomar 60 inch telescope. PTF uses 80\% of the 1.2 m and 50\% of the 1.5 m telescope time. With an exposure of 60 s the survey reaches a depth of mg0 {$\approx$} 21:3 and mR {$\approx$} 20:6 (5{$\sigma$}, median seeing). Four major experiments are planned for the five-year project: (1) a 5 day cadence supernova search; (2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90 s and 1 day; (3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in Orion; and (4) a 3{$\pi$} sr deep H-alpha survey. PTF provides automatic, real-time transient classification and follow-up, as well as a database including every source detected in each frame. This paper summarizes the PTF project, including several months of on-sky performance tests of the new survey camera, the observing plans, and the data reduction strategy. We conclude by detailing the first 51 PTF optical transient detections, found in commissioning data.},

Focusing on potentially detectable satellites around exoplanets and brown dwarfs (BDs), we might expect to find objects belonging to two main populations: planet-like satellites similar to Titan or the Galileian Satellites -- likely formed within the scope of core accretion; and binary-like objects, formed within different scenarios, such as disc instability. The properties of these potential satellites would be very different from each other. Additionally, we expect that their characterization would provide insightful information about the history of the system.

In this paper, we review different techniques, applied to DI planets/BDs, that can be used to discover such satellites. This was achieved by simulating a population of satellites around the exoplanet {$\beta~$}Pic b, which served as a test case. For each simulated satellite, the amplitude of DI, radial velocity, transit and astrometric signals, with respect to the planet, were retrieved and compared with the detection limits of current and future instruments. Furthermore, we compiled a list of 38 substellar companions discovered via DI to give a preliminary estimate on the probability of finding satellites extracted from the two populations mentioned above, with different techniques. This simplified approach shows that detection of planet-like satellites, though not strictly impossible, is very improbable.

  abstract = {Methods. To reveal bound features of directly imaged companions, whether for point-like or extended sources, we need to suppress the contribution from the source itself. Therefore, we developed a method based on the negative fake companion technique that first estimates the position in the field of view (FoV) and the flux of the imaged companion with high precision, then subtracts a rescaled model point spread function (PSF) from the imaged companion, using either an image of the central star or another PSF in the FoV. Next it performs techniques, such as angular differential imaging, to further remove quasi-static patterns of the star (i.e., speckle contaminants) that affect the residuals of close-in companions. Results. After testing our tools on simulated companions and disks and on systems that were chosen ad hoc, we applied the method to the sample of substellar objects observed with SPHERE during the SHINE GTO survey. Among the 27 planets and brown dwarfs we analyzed, most objects did not show remarkable features, which was as expected, with the possible exception of a point source close to DH Tau B. This candidate companion was detected in four different SPHERE observations, with an estimated mass of {$\sim$}1MJup, and a mass ratio with respect to the brown dwarf of 1/10. This binary system, if confirmed, would be the first of its kind, opening up interesting questions for the formation mechanism, evolution, and frequency of such pairs. In order to address the latter, the residuals and contrasts reached for 25 companions in the sample of substellar objects observed with SPHERE were derived. If the DH Tau Bb companion is real, the binary fraction obtained is {$\sim$}7\%, which is in good agreement with the results obtained for field brown dwarfs. Conclusions. While there may currently be many limitations affecting the exploration of bound features to directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs, next-generation instruments from the ground and space (i.e., JWST, ELT, and LUVOIR) will be able to image fainter objects and, thus, drive the application of this technique in upcoming searches for exo-moons and circumplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {With the major increase in the volume of the spectroscopic line lists needed to perform accurate radiative transfer calculations, disseminating accurate radiative data has become almost as much a challenge as computing it. Considering that many planetary science applications are only looking for heating rates or mid-to-low resolution spectra, any approach enabling such computations in an accurate and flexible way at a fraction of the computing and storage costs is highly valuable. For many of these reasons, the correlated-k approach has become very popular. Its major weakness has been the lack of ways to adapt the spectral grid/resolution of precomputed k-coefficients, making it difficult to distribute a generic database suited for many different applications. Currently, most users still need to have access to a line-by-line transfer code with the relevant line lists or high-resolution cross sections to compute k-coefficient tables at the desired resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that precomputed k-coefficients can be binned to a lower spectral resolution without any additional assumptions, and show how this can be done in practice. We then show that this binning procedure does not introduce any significant loss in accuracy. Along the way, we quantify how such an approach compares very favorably with the sampled cross section approach. This opens up a new avenue to deliver accurate radiative transfer data by providing mid-resolution k-coefficient tables to users who can later tailor those tables to their needs on the fly. To help with this final step, we briefly present Exo\_k, an open-access, open-source Python library designed to handle, tailor, and use many different formats of k-coefficient and cross-section tables in an easy and computationally efficient way.},

We investigated the effects of the [C/O]elem ratio on carbon fractionation using astrochemical models that incorporate isotope-selective photodissociation and isotope exchange reactions. The 12CO/13CO ratio could be lower than the elemental carbon isotope ratio due to isotope exchange reactions when the [C/O]elem ratio exceeds unity. The observed 12CO/13CO and H12CN/H13CN ratios around TW Hya could be reproduced when the [C/O]elem ratio is 2--5. In the vicinity of the lower boundary of the warm molecular layer, the formation of ices leads to the gas-phase [C/O]elem ratio approaching unity, irrespective of the total (gas + ice) [C/O]elem ratio. This phenomenon reduces the variation in the 12CO/13CO ratio across different [C/O]elem ratios.},

With this new capability, the need for a full 3D understanding to explain spectral features and their time dependence is becoming an vital aspect for consideration. To examine the atmospheric properties of directly imaged sub-Jupiter exoplanets, we use the three dimensional Exo-FMS general circulation model (GCM) to simulate a metal enhanced generic young sub-Jupiter object. We couple Exo-FMS to a kinetic chemistry scheme, a tracer based cloud formation scheme and a spectral radiative-transfer model to take into account the chemical and cloud feedback on the atmospheric thermochemical and dynamical properties. Our results show a highly complex feedback between clouds and chemistry onto the 3D temperature structure of the atmosphere, bringing about latitudinal differences and inducing time-dependent stormy features at photospheric pressures. This suggests a strong connection and feedback between the spatial cloud coverage and chemical composition of the atmosphere, with the temperature changes and dynamical motions induced by cloud opacity feedback driving chemical species behaviour. In addition, we also produce latitude dependent and time dependent spectra of our model to investigate atmospheric variability and periodicity in commonly used photometric bands. Overall, our efforts put the included physics in 3D simulations of exoplanets on par with contemporary 1D radiative-convective equilibrium modelling.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             The atmospheres of brown dwarfs have been long observed to exhibit a multitude of non-equilibrium chemical signatures and spectral variability across the L, T, and Y spectral types. We aim to investigate the link between the large-scale 3D atmospheric dynamics and time-dependent chemistry in the brown dwarf regime, and to assess its impact on spectral variability. We couple the miniature kinetic chemistry module `mini-chem' to the Exo-FMS general circulation model (GCM). We then perform a series of idealized brown dwarf regime atmospheric models to investigate the dynamical 3D chemical structures produced by our simulations. The GCM output is post-processed using a 3D radiative transfer model to investigate hemisphere-dependent spectral signatures and rotational variability. Our results show the expected strong non-equilibrium chemical behaviour brought on by vertical mixing and global spatial variations due to zonal flows. Chemical species are generally globally homogenized, showing variations of {\textpm}10~per~cent or less, dependent on pressure level, and follow the dynamical structures present in the atmosphere. However, we find localized storm regions and eddies can show higher contrasts, up to {\textpm}100~per~cent, in mixing ratio compared to the background global mean. This initial study represents another step in understanding the connection between 3D atmospheric flows in brown dwarfs and their rich chemical inventories.},

  abstract = {Recent spectroscopic observations of transiting hot Jupiters have permitted the derivation of the thermal structure and molecular abundances of H2O, CO2, CO and CH4 in these extreme atmospheres. Here, for the first time, we apply the technique of optimal estimation to determine the thermal structure and composition of an exoplanet by solving the inverse problem. The development of a suite of radiative transfer and retrieval tools for exoplanet atmospheres is described, building upon a retrieval algorithm which is extensively used in the study of our own Solar system. First, we discuss the plausibility of detection of different molecules in the dayside atmosphere of HD{$\quad$}189733b and the best-fitting spectrum retrieved from all publicly available sets of secondary eclipse observations between 1.45 and 24{$\quad\mu$}m. Additionally, we use contribution functions to assess the vertical sensitivity of the emission spectrum to temperatures and molecular composition. Over the altitudes probed by the contribution functions, the retrieved thermal structure shows an isothermal upper atmosphere overlying a deeper adiabatic layer (temperature decreasing with altitude), which is consistent with previously reported dynamical and observational results. The formal uncertainties on retrieved parameters are estimated conservatively using an analysis of the cross-correlation functions and the degeneracy between different atmospheric properties. The formal solution of the inverse problem suggests that the uncertainties on retrieved parameters are larger than suggested in previous studies, and that the presence of CO and CH4 is only marginally supported by the available data. Nevertheless, by including as broad a wavelength range as possible in the retrieval, we demonstrate that available spectra of HD{$\quad$}189733b can constrain a family of potential solutions for the atmospheric structure.},

  abstract = {Cold, low-mass, field brown dwarfs are important for constraining the terminus of the stellar mass function, and also for optimizing atmospheric studies of exoplanets. In 2020 new model grids for such objects were made available: Sonora-Bobcat and ATMO 2020. Also, new candidate cold brown dwarfs were announced, and new spectroscopic observations at {$\lambda$} {$\approx$} 4.8 {$\mu$}m were published. In this paper we present new infrared photometry for some of the coldest brown dwarfs, and put the new data and models together to explore the properties of these objects. We reconfirm the importance of mixing in these atmospheres, which leads to CO and NH3 abundances that differ by orders of magnitude from chemical equilibrium values. We also demonstrate that the new models retain the known factor {$\greaterequivlnt$}3 discrepancy with observations at 2 {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\lambda$} {$\mu$}m {$\lessequivlnt$} 4, for brown dwarfs cooler than 600 K. We show that the entire 1 {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\lambda$} {$\mu$}m {$\lessequivlnt$} 20 energy distribution of six brown dwarfs with 260 {$\leq$} T eff K {$\leq$} 475 can be well reproduced, for the first time, by model atmospheres which include disequilibrium chemistry as well as a photospheric temperature gradient which deviates from the standard radiative/convective equilibrium value. This change to the pressure--temperature profile is not unexpected for rotating and turbulent atmospheres that are subject to diabatic processes. A limited grid of modified-adiabat model colors is generated, and used to estimate temperatures and metallicities for the currently known Y dwarfs. A compilation of the photometric data used here is given in Appendix C.},

We also present a reanalysis of H-band imaging data from the Keck Observatory Archive, for an 11th Y dwarf. These data are combined with earlier MKO-system photometry, Spitzer and WISE mid-infrared photometry, and available trigonometric parallaxes, to create a sample of late-type brown dwarfs that includes 10 T9--T9.5 dwarfs or dwarf systems, and 16 Y dwarfs. We compare the data to our models, which include updated H2 and NH3 opacity, as well as low-temperature condensate clouds. The models qualitatively reproduce the trends seen in the observed colors; however, there are discrepancies of around a factor of two in flux for the Y0--Y1 dwarfs, with Teff {$\approx$} 350--400 K. At Teff {$\sim$} 400 K, the problems could be addressed by significantly reducing the NH3 absorption, for example by halving the abundance of NH3 possibly by vertical mixing. At Teff {$\sim$} 350 K, the discrepancy may be resolved by incorporating thick water clouds. The onset of these clouds might occur over a narrow range in Teff, as indicated by the observed small change in 5 {$\mu$}m flux over a large change in J - W2 color. Of the known Y dwarfs, the reddest in J -W2 are WISEP J182831.08+265037.8 and WISE J085510.83-071442.5. We interpret the former as a pair of identical 300--350 K dwarfs, and the latter as a 250 K dwarf.

From {$\approx$}100-200 least-squares-deconvolved (LSD) profiles of circularly polarized spectra of each star, we confirm the stellar rotation periods of the six M dwarfs and explore their large-scale magnetic field topology and its evolution with time using both the method based on principal component analysis (PCA) proposed recently and Zeeman-Doppler imaging. All M dwarfs show large-scale field variations on the time-scale of their rotation periods, directly seen from the circularly polarized LSD profiles using the PCA method. We detect a magnetic polarity reversal for the fully convective M dwarf GJ 1151, and a possible inversion in progress for Gl 905. The four fully convective M dwarfs of our small sample (Gl 905, GJ 1289, GJ 1151, and GJ 1286) show a larger amount of temporal variations (mainly in field strength and axisymmetry) than the two partly convective ones (Gl 617B and Gl 408). Surprisingly, the six M dwarfs show large-scale field strengths in the range between 20 and 200 G similar to those of M dwarfs rotating significantly faster. Our findings imply that the large-scale fields of very slowly rotating M dwarfs are likely generated through dynamo processes operating in a different regime than those of the faster rotators that have been magnetically characterized so far.},

  abstract = {The CHEOPS space mission dedicated to exoplanet follow-up was launched in December 2019, equipped with the capacity to perform photometric measurements at the 20 ppm level. As CHEOPS carries out its observations in a broad optical passband, it can provide insights into the reflected light from exoplanets and constrain the short-wavelength thermal emission for the hottest of planets by observing occultations and phase curves. Here, we report the first CHEOPS observation of an occultation, namely, that of the hot Jupiter WASP-189 b, a               M               P               {$\approx$} 2               M               J               planet orbiting an A-type star. We detected the occultation of WASP-189 b at high significance in individual measurements and derived an occultation depth of dF = 87.9 {\textpm} 4.3 ppm based on four occultations. We compared these measurements to model predictions and we find that they are consistent with an unreflective atmosphere heated to a temperature of 3435 {\textpm} 27 K, when assuming inefficient heat redistribution. Furthermore, we present two transits of WASP-189 b observed by CHEOPS. These transits have an asymmetric shape that we attribute to gravity darkening of the host star caused by its high rotation rate. We used these measurements to refine the planetary parameters, finding a {\textasciitilde}25\% deeper transit compared to the discovery paper and updating the radius of WASP-189 b to 1.619 {\textpm} 0.021               R               J               . We further measured the projected orbital obliquity to be               {$\lambda$}               = 86.4               -4.4               +2.9{$^\circ$}               , a value that is in good agreement with a previous measurement from spectroscopic observations, and derived a true obliquity of {$\Psi$} = 85.4 {\textpm} 4.3{$^\circ$}. Finally, we provide reference values for the photometric precision attained by the CHEOPS satellite: for the               V               = 6.6 mag star, and using a 1-h binning, we obtain a residual RMS between 10 and 17 ppm on the individual light curves, and 5.7 ppm when combining the four visits.},

We want to test the observability of H\textsubscript{3{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+{$<$}sup/{$>$} emission with CRIRES at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), providing adequate spectral resolution for planetary atmospheric lines in NIR spectra. We search for signatures of planetary H\textsubscript{3{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+{$<$}sup/{$>$} emission in the \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>\prime$} band, using spectra of HD 209458 obtained during and after secondary eclipse of its transiting planet HD 209458 b. We searched for H\textsubscript{3{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+{$<$}sup/{$>$} emission signatures in spectra containing the combined light of the star and, possibly, the planet. With the information on the ephemeris of the transiting planet, we derive the radial velocities at the time of observation and search for the emission at the expected line positions. We also apply a cross-correlation test to search for planetary signals and use a shift and add technique combining all observed spectra taken after secondary eclipse to calculate an upper emission limit. We do not find signatures of atmospheric H\textsubscript{3{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+{$<$}sup/{$>$} emission in the spectra containing the combined light of HD 209458 and its orbiting planet. We calculate the emission limit for the H\textsubscript{3{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+{$<$}sup/{$>$} line at 3953.0 nm [\emph{Q{$<$}i/{$>$}(1,0)] to be 8.32 {\texttimes} 10\textsuperscript{18{$<$}sup/{$>$} W and a limit of 5.34 {\texttimes} 10\textsuperscript{18{$<$}sup/{$>$} W for the line at 3985.5 nm [\emph{Q{$<$}i/{$>$}(3,0)]. Comparing our emission limits to the theoretical predictions suggests that we lack 1 to 3 magnitudes of sensitivity to measure H\textsubscript{3{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{+{$<$}sup/{$>$} emission in our target object. We show that under more favorable weather conditions the data quality can be improved significantly, reaching 5 {\texttimes} 10\textsuperscript{16{$<$}sup/{$>$} W for star-planet systems that are close to Earth. We estimate that pushing the detection limit down to 10\textsuperscript{15{$<$}sup/{$>$} W will be possible with ground-based observations with future instrumentation, for example, the European Extremly Large Telescope.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

In this study, we leverage moderate spectral resolution observations (R {$\sim$} 2700) with the G395H grating of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board JWST to characterize the nearby (9.9 pc) Y dwarf WISEPA J182831.08+265037.8. With the NIRSpec G395H 2.88--5.12 {$\mu$}m spectrum, we measure the abundances of CO, CO2, CH4, H2S, NH3, and H2O, which are the major carbon-, nitrogen-, oxygen-, and sulfur-bearing species in the atmosphere. Based on the retrieved volume mixing ratios with the atmospheric retrieval framework CHIMERA, we report that the C/O ratio is 0.45 {\textpm} 0.01, close to the solar C/O value of 0.458, and the metallicity is +0.30 {\textpm} 0.02 dex. Comparison between the retrieval results and the forward modeling results suggests that the model bias for C/O and metallicity could be as high as 0.03 and 0.97 dex, respectively. We also report a lower limit of the 12CO/13CO ratio of {$>$}40, being consistent with the nominal solar value of 90. Our results highlight the potential for JWST to measure the C/O ratios down to percent-level precision and characterize isotopologues of cold planetary atmospheres similar to WISE 1828.},

The binary was spatially resolved, and the spectra of the two sources (MIR1 and MIR2) were obtained simultaneously for the first time. Hundreds of 12CO {$\nu$} = 0--1, {$\nu$} = 1--2 lines, and {$\nu$} = 0--1 transitions of the isotopes of 12CO were detected in absorption and are blueshifted compared to the cloud velocity vLSR = -38 km s-1. We decompose and identify kinematic components from the velocity profiles and apply rotation diagram and curve-of-growth analyses to determine their physical properties. The temperatures and column densities of the identified components range from 30 to 700 K and 1021 to 1022 cm-2, respectively. Our curve-of-growth analyses consider two scenarios. One assumes a foreground slab with a partial covering factor, which well reproduces the absorption of most of the components. The other assumes a circumstellar disk with an outward-decreasing temperature in the vertical direction and reproduces the absorption of all of the hot components. We attribute the physical origins of the identified components to the foreground envelope ({$<$}100 K), post-J-shock regions (200--300 K), and clumpy structures on the circumstellar disks ({$\sim$}600 K). We propose that the components with a J-shock origin are akin to water maser spots in the same region and complement the physical information of water masers along the direction of their movements.},

In one analysis, the model assumes a foreground slab. The other assumes a circumstellar disk with an outward-decreasing temperature in the vertical direction. The disk model is favored because fewer geometry constraints are needed, although this model faces challenges as the internal heating source is unknown. We discuss the chemical abundances along the line of sight based on the CO-to-H               2               O connection. In the hot gas, all oxygen not locked in CO resides in water.

  abstract = {Infrared spectra of brown dwarfs have the potential to tell us about their temperature structures and molecular abundances. With such information we can explore the atmospheric chemistry and dynamics within the brown dwarf atmospheres. The standard approach to interpreting brown dwarf spectra has been through the use of self-consistent grid models that attempt to fit basic stellar parameters such as the effective temperature and surface gravity and occasionally eddy diffusivity. Line et al. 2014 presented a novel inverse approach based upon earth and solar system atmosphere remote sensing techniques to determine the detailed temperature profile and molecular gas abundances in brown dwarf atmospheres without the need for grid models. Such approaches make few assumptions about the nature of the molecular compositions and temperature structure, thus obtaining an unbiased estimate of the objects atmospheric properties. In this investigation we improve upon and expand the work of Line et al. 2014 by first by implementing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimator and second applying our analysis to {\textasciitilde}10 cloud-free late T-dwarf SPEX spectra. From the analysis of many objects we aim to understand the dispersion of atmospheric properties such as their effective temperature, gravity, radii, water abundances, methane abundances, temperature structures, C/O ratios and other properties within a given spectral class. Furthermore we can identify how various spectral indices such as the J-K or H-K etc., colors correlate with the various aforementioned atmospheric properties. Such investigations allow us to better understand the physics and chemistry operating in brown dwarf atmospheres in an unbiased way.},

The formulation quantifies the degrees of freedom and information content of the spectrum with respect to geophysical parameters; herein, we focus specifically on temperature and composition. First, we apply the technique to synthetic near-infrared spectra and explore the influence of spectral signal-to-noise ratio and resolution (the two important parameters when designing a future instrument) on the information content of the data. As expected, we find that the number of retrievable parameters increases with increasing signal-to-noise ratio and resolution, although the gains quickly level off for large values. Second, we apply the methods to the previously studied dayside near-infrared emission spectrum of HD 189733b and compare the results of our retrieval with those obtained by others.},

Hot Jupiters that form beyond the major volatile (H2O/CO/CO2) ice lines and subsequently migrate post disk-dissipation are predicted have atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) near 1 and subsolar metallicities2, whereas planets that migrate through the disk before dissipation are predicted to be heavily polluted by infalling O-rich icy planetesimals, resulting in C/O\,{$<$}\,0.5 and super-solar metallicities1,2. Previous observations of hot Jupiters have been able to provide bounded constraints on either H2O (refs. 3--5) or CO (refs. 6,7), but not both for the same planet, leaving uncertain4 the true elemental C and O inventory and subsequent C/O and metallicity determinations. Here we report spectroscopic observations of a typical transiting hot Jupiter, WASP-77Ab. From these, we determine the atmospheric gas volume mixing ratio constraints on both H2O and CO (9.5\,{\texttimes}\,10-5--1.5\,{\texttimes}\,10-4 and 1.2\,{\texttimes}\,10-4--2.6\,{\texttimes}\,10-4, respectively). From these bounded constraints, we are able to derive the atmospheric C/H (\$\$\{0.35\}\_\{-0.10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.17\}\$\$\,{\texttimes}\,solar) and O/H (\$\$\{0.32\}\_\{-0.08\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\$\$\,{\texttimes}\,solar) abundances and the corresponding atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O\,=\,0.59\,{\textpm}\,0.08; the solar value is 0.55). The sub-solar (C+O)/H (\$\$\{0.33\}\_\{-0.09\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.13\}\$\$\,{\texttimes}\,solar) is suggestive of a metal-depleted atmosphere relative to what is expected for Jovian-like planets1 while the near solar value of C/O rules out the disk-free migration/C-rich2 atmosphere scenario.},

With these spectra we are able to directly constrain the molecular abundances for the first time of H2O, CH4, CO, CO2, NH3, H2S, and Na+K, surface gravity, effective temperature, thermal structure, photometric radius, and cloud optical depths. We find that ammonia, water, methane, and the alkali metals are present and that their abundances are well constrained in all 11 objects. We find no significant trend in the water, methane, or ammonia abundances with temperature, but find a very strong ({$>$}25{$\sigma$}) decreasing trend in the alkali metal abundances with decreasing effective temperature, indicative of alkali rainout. As expected from previous work, we also find little evidence for optically thick clouds. With the methane and water abundances, we derive the intrinsic atmospheric metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratios. We find in our sample that metallicities are typically subsolar (-0.4 {$<$} [M/H] {$<$} 0.1 dex) and carbon-to-oxygen ratios are somewhat supersolar (0.4 {$<$} C/O {$<$} 1.2), different than expectations from the local stellar population. We also find that the retrieved vertical thermal profiles are consistent with radiative equilibrium over the photospheric regions. Finally, we find that our retrieved effective temperatures are lower than previous inferences for some objects and that some of our radii are larger than expectations from evolutionary models, possibly indicative of unresolved binaries. This investigation and method represent a new and powerful paradigm for using spectra to determine the fundamental chemical and physical processes governing cool brown dwarf atmospheres.},

The line intensity and position calculations were carried out using a newly determined piece-wise dipole moment function (DMF) in conjunction with the wavefunctions calculated from an experimentally determined potential energy function from Coxon \& Hajigeorgiou. A direct-fit method that simultaneously fits all the reliable experimental rovibrational matrix elements has been used to construct the dipole moment function near equilibrium internuclear distance. In order to extend the amount and quality of input experimental parameters, new Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy experiments were carried out to enable measurements of the lines in the 4--0 band with low uncertainty as well as the first measurements of lines in the 6--0 band. A new high-level ab initio DMF, derived from a finite field approach has been calculated to cover internuclear distances far from equilibrium. Accurate partition sums have been derived for temperatures up to 9000 K. In addition to air- and self-induced broadening and shift parameters, those induced by CO2 and H2 are now provided for planetary applications. A complete set of broadening and shift parameters was calculated based on sophisticated extrapolation of high-quality measured data.

Near-IR spectroscopy shows a spectral type of L7 {\textpm} 1 and reveals a triangular H-band continuum and weak alkali (K i and Na i) lines, hallmarks of low surface gravity. Near-IR astrometry from the Hawaii Infrared Parallax Program gives a distance of 24.6 {\textpm} 1.4 pc and indicates a much fainter J-band absolute magnitude than field L dwarfs. The position and kinematics of PSO J318.5-22 point to membership in the {$\beta$} Pic moving group. Evolutionary models give a temperature of 1160 K and a mass of 6.5 MJup, making PSO J318.5-22 one of the lowest mass free-floating objects in the solar neighborhood. This object adds to the growing list of low-gravity field L dwarfs and is the first to be strongly deficient in methane relative to its estimated temperature. Comparing their spectra suggests that young L dwarfs with similar ages and temperatures can have different spectral signatures of youth. For the two objects with well constrained ages (PSO J318.5-22 and 2MASS J0355+11), we find their temperatures are {$\approx$}400 K cooler than field objects of similar spectral type but their luminosities are similar, i.e., these young L dwarfs are very red and unusually cool but not ``underluminous.'' Altogether, PSO J318.5-22 is the first free-floating object with the colors, magnitudes, spectrum, luminosity, and mass that overlap the young dusty planets around HR 8799 and 2MASS J1207-39.},

  abstract = {The giant impact hypothesis remains the leading theory for lunar origin. However, current models struggle to explain the Moon's composition and isotopic similarity with Earth. Here we present a new lunar origin model. High-energy, high-angular-momentum giant impacts can create a post-impact structure that exceeds the corotation limit, which defines the hottest thermal state and angular momentum possible for a corotating body. In a typical super-corotation-limit body, traditional definitions of mantle, atmosphere, and disk are not appropriate, and the body forms a new type of planetary structure, named a synestia. Using simulations of cooling synestias combined with dynamic, thermodynamic, and geochemical calculations, we show that satellite formation from a synestia can produce the main features of our Moon. We find that cooling drives mixing of the structure, and condensation generates moonlets that orbit within the synestia, surrounded by tens of bars of bulk silicate Earth vapor. The moonlets and growing moon are heated by the vapor until the first major element (Si) begins to vaporize and buffer the temperature. Moonlets equilibrate with bulk silicate Earth vapor at the temperature of silicate vaporization and the pressure of the structure, establishing the lunar isotopic composition and pattern of moderately volatile elements. Eventually, the cooling synestia recedes within the lunar orbit, terminating the main stage of lunar accretion. Our model shifts the paradigm for lunar origin from specifying a certain impact scenario to achieving a Moon-forming synestia. Giant impacts that produce potential Moon-forming synestias were common at the end of terrestrial planet formation.},

  abstract = {During accretion, terrestrial bodies attain a wide range of thermal and rotational states, which are accompanied by significant changes in physical structure (size, shape, pressure and temperature profile, etc.). However, variations in structure have been neglected in most studies of rocky planet formation and evolution. Here we present a new code, the Highly Eccentric Rotating Concentric U (potential) Layers Equilibrium Structure (HERCULES) code, that solves for the equilibrium structure of planets as a series of overlapping constant-density spheroids. Using HERCULES and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, we show that Earth-like bodies display a dramatic range of morphologies. For any rotating planetary body, there is a thermal limit beyond which the rotational velocity at the equator intersects the Keplerian orbital velocity. Beyond this corotation limit (CoRoL), a hot planetary body forms a structure, which we name a synestia, with a corotating inner region connected to a disk-like outer region. By analyzing calculations of giant impacts and models of planet formation, we show that typical rocky planets are substantially vaporized multiple times during accretion. For the expected angular momentum of growing planets, a large fraction of post-impact bodies will exceed the CoRoL and form synestias. The common occurrence of hot, rotating states during accretion has major implications for planet formation and the properties of the final planets. In particular, the structure of post-impact bodies influences the physical processes that control accretion, core formation, and internal evolution. Synestias also lead to new mechanisms for satellite formation. Finally, the wide variety of possible structures for terrestrial bodies also expands the mass-radius range for rocky exoplanets.},

  abstract = {The chemical species containing carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in atmospheres of giant planets, brown dwarfs (T and L dwarfs), and low-mass stars (M dwarfs) are identified as part of a comprehensive set of thermochemical equilibrium and kinetic calculations for all elements. The calculations cover a wide temperature and pressure range in the upper portions of giant planetary and T-, L-, and M-dwarf atmospheres. Emphasis is placed on the major gases CH 4, CO, NH 3, N 2, and H 2O but other less abundant gases are included. The results presented are independent of particular model atmospheres, and can be used to constrain model atmosphere temperatures and pressures from observations of different gases. The influence of metallicity on the speciation of these key elements under pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions relevant to low-mass object atmospheres is discussed. The results of the thermochemical equilibrium computations indicate that several compounds may be useful to establish temperature or pressure scales for giant planet, brown dwarf, or dwarf star atmospheres. We find that ethane and methanol abundance are useful temperature probes in giant planets and methane dwarfs such as Gl 229B, and that CO 2 can serve as a temperature probe in more massive objects. Imidogen (NH) abundances are a unique pressure-independent temperature probe for all objects. Total pressure probes for warmer brown dwarfs and M dwarfs are HCN, HCNO, and CH 2O. No temperature-independent probes for the total pressure in giant planets or T-dwarf atmospheres are identified among the more abundant C, N, and O bearing gases investigated here.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context{$<$}i/{$>$}. The \emph{James Webb{$<$}i/{$>$} Space Telescope is currently at the forefront of the search for atmospheres of exoplanets. However, the observation of atmospheres of Earth-like planets pushes the limits of the instruments, and often, multiple observations must be combined. As with most instruments, telescope time is unfortunately extremely limited. Over the course of cycle 1, approximately 100 hours have been dedicated to the TRAPPIST-1 planets. This system is therefore studied in unusually great detail. However, the first two sets of observations of the innermost two planets show that these planets most likely lack a thick atmosphere. The question therefore arises whether terrestrial planets around M stars have atmospheres or do not have atmospheres at all.\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}. We aim to determine the atmospheric survivability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets by modelling the response of the upper atmosphere to incoming stellar high-energy radiation. Through this case study, we also aim to learn more about rocky planet atmospheres in the habitable zone around low-mass M dwarfs.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. We simulated the upper atmospheres of the TRAPPIST-1 planets using the Kompot code, which is a self-consistent thermo-chemical code. Specifically, we studied the atmospheric mass loss due to Jeans escape induced by stellar high-energy radiation. This was achieved through a grid of models that account for the differences in planetary properties and irradiances of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, as well as different atmospheric properties. This grid allows for the explorations of the different factors influencing atmospheric loss.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. The present-day irradiance of the TRAPPIST-1 planets would lead to the loss of an Earth's atmosphere within just some hundreds of million years. When we take into account the much more active early stages of a low-mass M dwarf, the planets undergo a period of even more extreme mass loss, regardless of planetary mass or atmospheric composition.\emph{Conclusions{$<$}i/{$>$}. The losses calculated in this work indicate that it is unlikely that any significant atmosphere could survive for any extended amount of time around any of the TRAPPIST-1 planets based on present-day irradiance levels. The assumptions used here allow us to generalise the results, and we conclude that the results tentatively indicate that this conclusion applies to all Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of low-mass M dwarfs.}}}}}}},

The analysis produces a simultaneous determination of effective temperature (T eff), surface gravity (log g), magnetic-field strength (B), and projected rotational velocity (). Our method employed synthetic spectra and high-resolution (R {$\sim$} 45,000) near-infrared spectra taken with the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) to fit specific K-band spectral regions most sensitive to those parameters. The use of these high-resolution spectra reduces the influence of distance uncertainties, reddening, and non-photospheric continuum emission on the parameter determinations. The median total (fit + systematic) uncertainties were 170 K, 0.28 dex, 0.60 kG, 2.5 km s-1 for T eff, log g, B, and , respectively. We determined B for 41 Taurus YSOs (upper limits for the remainder) and find systematic offsets (lower T eff, higher log g and ) in parameters when B is measurable but not considered in the fit. The average log g for the Class ii and Class iii objects differs by 0.23 {\textpm} 0.05 dex, which is consistent with Class iii objects being the more evolved members of the star-forming region. However, the dispersion in log g is greater than the uncertainties, which highlights how the YSO classification correlates with age (log g), yet there are exceptionally young (lower log g) Class iii YSOs and relatively old (higher log g) Class ii YSOs with unexplained evolutionary histories. The spectra from this work are provided in an online repository along with TW Hydrae Association comparison objects and the model grid used in our analysis.},

  abstract = {The recent observations on WASP-39 b by JWST have revealed hints of high metallicity within the atmosphere compared to its host star. There are various theories on how these high metallic atmospheres emerge. In this study, we closely investigate the impact of extreme escape in the form of hydrodynamic escape to see its impact on atmospheric metallicity and spectral features such as CH4, CO2 and SO2. We perform a grid simulation, with an adapted version of MESA that includes hydrodynamic escape to fully evolve planets with similar masses and radii to the currently observed WASP-39 b estimates. By making use of (photo)chemical kinetics and radiative transfer codes, we evaluate the transmission spectra at various time intervals throughout the simulation. Our results indicate that the massive size of WASP-39 b limits the metal enhancement to a maximum of {$\sim$}1.23{\texttimes} the initial metallicity. When incorporating metal drag, this enhancement factor is repressed to an even greater degree, resulting in an enrichment of at most {$\sim$}0.4\%. As a consequence, when assuming an initial solar metallicity, metal-enriched spectral features like SO2 are still missing after {$\sim$}9 Gyr into the simulation. This paper, thus, demonstrates that hydrodynamic escape cannot be the primary process behind the high metallicity observed in the atmosphere of WASP-39 b, suggesting instead that a metal-enhanced atmosphere was established during its formation.},

  abstract = {The recent observations on WASP-39 b by JWST have revealed hints of high metallicity within the atmosphere compared to its host star. There are various theories on how these high metallic atmospheres emerge. In this study, we closely investigate the impact of extreme escape in the form of hydrodynamic escape to see its impact on atmospheric metallicity and spectral features such as CH4, CO2 and SO2. We perform a grid simulation, with an adapted version of MESA that includes hydrodynamic escape to fully evolve planets with similar masses and radii to the currently observed WASP-39 b estimates. By making use of (photo)chemical kinetics and radiative transfer codes, we evaluate the transmission spectra at various time intervals throughout the simulation. Our results indicate that the massive size of WASP-39 b limits the metal enhancement to a maximum of {$\sim$}1.23{\texttimes} the initial metallicity. When incorporating metal drag, this enhancement factor is repressed to an even greater degree, resulting in an enrichment of at most {$\sim$}0.4\%. As a consequence, when assuming an initial solar metallicity, metal-enriched spectral features like SO2 are still missing after {$\sim$}9 Gyr into the simulation. This paper, thus, demonstrates that hydrodynamic escape cannot be the primary process behind the high metallicity observed in the atmosphere of WASP-39 b, suggesting instead that a metal-enhanced atmosphere was established during its formation.},

  abstract = {We present broad-band spectra of a sample of 21 low-luminosity sources in the Trapezium cluster, with masses in the range 0.008-0.10Msolar (assuming an age of 1Myr). These were selected for low extinction in most cases, and are located west of the brighter nebulosity. The spectra are in the H bandpass (1.4-1.95{$\mu$}m) and K bandpass (1.9-2.5{$\mu$}m) also for most of the brighter sources, with a resolution of 50nm. They were taken with the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) using the CGS4 spectrometer. Absorption by water vapour bands is detected in all the substellar candidates except one, which is a highly reddened object with strong H2 emission and an anomalously blue (I-J) colour, implying that it is a very young cluster member with circumstellar matter. The observation of prominent water vapour bands confirms the low effective temperatures implied by our (I-J) colour measurements in an earlier paper, and would imply late-M or L spectral types if these were older field dwarfs. However, the profiles of the H-bandpass spectra are very different from those of field dwarfs with similar water absorption strength, demonstrating that they are not foreground or background objects. In addition, the CO absorption bands at 2.3{$\mu$}m and the Nai absorption feature at 2.21{$\mu$}m are very weak for such cool sources. All these features are quite well reproduced by the AMES-Dusty-1999 model atmospheres of Allard et al., and arise from the much lower gravities predicted for the Trapezium sources (3.5Jup. Following a minor update to our previous J-band photometry, due to a new UKIRT filter calibration, there are {\textasciitilde}15 planetary mass candidates in the full data set.},

Some of the candidates could be protostars (either stellar or substellar) given their very red colors. Based on the age of the ONC and the photometry predicted by theoretical evolutionary models, the faintest candidates could have masses of 1--2 M Jup. This sample of candidates may prove to be valuable for studying various aspects of young brown dwarfs, including their mass function and minimum mass. However, spectroscopy is needed to confirm the membership (via signatures of youth) and late spectral types of the candidates. Finally, I note that most of the ``Jupiter-mass binary objects'' that have been previously identified with these JWST images are absent from my sample of candidates because their colors are indicative of reddened background sources rather than young brown dwarfs, or their photometry is inadequate for assessing their nature because of very low signal-to-noise ratios and/or detections in only a few bands.},

I have identified candidate members that appear to share similar kinematics and ages with bona fide members compiled by Gagn{\'e} et al. (2017), and I have assessed their membership using radial velocities and spectroscopic diagnostics of age from various sources. My new catalog of adopted members contains 67 Gaia sources in 55 systems. The histogram of spectral types for TWA peaks near M5 ({$\sim$}0.15 M {$\odot$}), resembling the distributions measured for other nearby young associations. The UVW velocities of its members indicate that the association is expanding. The rate of expansion corresponds to an age of Myr. In a Gaia color--magnitude diagram, the members of TWA exhibit well-defined sequences of single stars and unresolved binary stars. The combined sequence of low-mass stars in TWA is indicative of an age of Myr when compared to the sequence for Upper Centaurus Lupus/Lower Centaurus Crux, for which an age of 20 Myr is assumed. Based on these expansion and isochronal ages, I have adopted an age of 10 {\textpm} 2 Myr for TWA. Finally, I have used mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer to check for excess emission from circumstellar disks among the TWA members. Fourteen members have detected disks, all of which have been reported in previous studies. The fraction of members at {$\leq$} M6 ({$\greaterequivlnt$}0.1 M {$\odot$}) that have full, transitional, or evolved disks is 10/52 = . That value is similar to the fraction previously measured for the Upper Sco association, which is roughly coeval with TWA.},

By combining these measurements with previous observations with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph and other facilities, we have classified the members of Taurus according to whether they show evidence of circumstellar disks and envelopes (classes I, II, and III). Through these classifications, we find that the disk fraction in Taurus, N(II)/N(II+III), is {$\sim$}75\% for solar-mass stars and declines to {$\sim$}45\% for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (0.01--0.3 M{$\Sun$}). This dependence on stellar mass is similar to that measured for Chamaeleon I, although the disk fraction in Taurus is slightly higher overall, probably because of its younger age (1 Myr versus 2--3 Myr). In comparison, the disk fraction for solar-mass stars is much lower ({$\sim$}20\%) in IC 348 and {$\sigma$} Ori, which are denser than Taurus and Chamaeleon I and are roughly coeval with the latter. These data indicate that disk lifetimes for solar-mass stars are longer in star-forming regions that have lower stellar densities. Through an analysis of multiple epochs of Spitzer photometry that are available for {$\sim$}200 Taurus members, we find that stars with disks exhibit significantly greater mid-infrared (mid-IR) variability than diskless stars, which agrees with the results of similar variability measurements for a smaller sample of stars in Chamaeleon I. The variability fraction for stars with disks is higher in Taurus than in Chamaeleon I, indicating that the IR variability of disks decreases with age. Finally, we have used our data in Taurus to refine the observational criteria for primordial, evolved, and transitional disks. The ratio of the number of evolved and transitional disks to the number of primordial disks in Taurus is 15/98 for spectral types of K5--M5, indicating a timescale of 0.15 {\texttimes} {$\tau$}primordial {$\sim$} 0.45 Myr for the clearing of the inner regions of optically thick disks. After applying the same criteria to older clusters and associations (2--10 Myr) that have been observed with Spitzer, we find that the proportions of evolved and transitional disks in those populations are consistent with the measurements in Taurus when their star formation histories are properly taken into account.},

We then use observations of these populations to test theories of star formation and evolution at low masses. For comparison to the formation models, we consider the initial mass function, stellar multiplicity, circumstellar disks, protostellar characteristics, and kinematic and spatial distributions at birth for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. To test the evolutionary models, we focus on measurements of dynamical masses and empirical Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for young brown dwarfs and planetary companions.},

In these data, the fundamental band of CH4 is absent, and the fundamental band of CO is weak. The nondetection of CH4 reinforces a previously observed trend of weaker CH4 with younger ages among L dwarfs, which has been attributed to enhanced nonequilibrium chemistry among young objects. The weakness of CO may reflect an additional atmospheric property that varies with age, such as the temperature gradient or cloud thickness. We are able to reproduce the broad shape of the spectrum with an ATMO cloudless model that has T eff = 1300 K, nonequilibrium chemistry, and a temperature gradient reduction caused by fingering convection. However, the fundamental bands of CH4 and CO are somewhat stronger in the model. In addition, the model temperature of 1300 K is higher than expected from evolutionary models given the luminosity and age of TWA 27B (T eff = 1200 K). Previous models of young L-type objects suggest that the inclusion of clouds could potentially resolve these issues; it remains to be seen whether cloudy models can provide a good fit to the 1--5 {$\mu$}m data from NIRSpec. TWA 27B exhibits emission in Paschen transitions and the He I triplet at 1.083 {$\mu$}m, which are signatures of accretion that provide the first evidence of a circumstellar disk. We have used the NIRSpec data to estimate the bolometric luminosity of TWA 27B (log L/L {$\odot$} = -4.466 {\textpm} 0.014), which implies a mass of 5--6 M Jup according to evolutionary models.},

Low-resolution spectroscopy has been performed on four promising candidates, three of which have molecular absorption bands that indicate late spectral types. Among those late-type objects, the brightest is similar to known young L dwarfs while the other two show the so-called 3.4 {$\mu$}m feature that has been previously observed in the diffuse interstellar medium and in the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan, which has been attributed to an unidentified aliphatic hydrocarbon. Those two objects also exhibit features between 1.1 and 2.6 {$\mu$}m that we identify as the overtone and combination bands for that hydrocarbon. After accounting for the hydrocarbon bands, the remaining spectral features are consistent with youth and inconsistent with field dwarfs. Based on the low extinctions of those objects and the strengths of the overtone and combination bands, we conclude that the hydrocarbon resides in their atmospheres rather than in foreground material. Thus, our detections of the 3.4 {$\mu$}m feature are the first in atmospheres outside of the solar system. The presence of this hydrocarbon is not predicted by any atmospheric models of young brown dwarfs. Based on its luminosity and evolutionary models, the faintest new member of IC 348 has an estimated mass of 3-4 M Jup, making it a strong contender for the least massive free-floating brown dwarf that has been directly imaged to date. *Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope and the Gaia mission.},

We are developing a new atmospheric retrieval methodology to help assess the science return and inform the instrument design for such future missions, and ultimately interpret the resulting observations. Our retrieval technique employs a geometric albedo model coupled with both a Markov chain Monte Carlo Ensemble Sampler (emcee) and a multimodal nested sampling algorithm (MultiNest) to map the posterior distribution. This combination makes the global evidence calculation more robust for any given model and highlights possible discrepancies in the likelihood maps. As a proof of concept, our current atmospheric model contains one or two cloud layers, methane as a major absorber, and a H2--He background gas. This 6-to-9 parameter model is appropriate for Jupiter-like planets and can be easily expanded in the future. In addition to deriving the marginal likelihood distribution and confidence intervals for the model parameters, we perform model selection to determine the significance of methane and cloud detection as a function of expected signal-to-noise ratio in the presence of spectral noise correlations. After internal validation, the method is applied to realistic spectra of Jupiter, Saturn, and HD 99492c, a model observing target. We find that the presence or absence of clouds and methane can be determined with high confidence, while parameter uncertainties are model dependent and correlated. Such general methods will also be applicable to the interpretation of direct imaging spectra of cloudy terrestrial planets.},

Direct astronomical measurements of CO absorption lines in the solar photosphere have previously yielded a wide range of O isotope ratios. Here, we reanalyze the line strengths for high-temperature rovibrational transitions in photospheric CO from ATMOS FTS data, and obtain an 18O depletion of {$\delta$}18O\,=\,-50\,{\textpm}\,11‰ (1{$\sigma$}). From the same analysis we find a carbon isotope ratio of {$\delta$}13C\,=\,-48\,{\textpm}\,7‰ (1{$\sigma$}) for the photosphere. This implies that the primary reservoirs of carbon on the terrestrial planets are enriched in 13C relative to the bulk material from which the solar system formed, possibly as a result of CO self-shielding or inheritance from the parent cloud.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing instruments are heavily used to provide observations for both the operational and research communities. These sensors do not provide direct observations of the desired atmospheric variables, but instead, retrieval algorithms are necessary to convert the indirect observations into the variable of interest. It is critical to be aware of the underlying assumptions made by many retrieval algorithms, including that the retrieval problem is often ill posed and that there are various sources of uncertainty that need to be treated properly. In short, the retrieval challenge is to invert a set of noisy observations to obtain estimates of atmospheric quantities. The problem is often complicated by imperfect forward models, by imperfect prior knowledge, and by the existence of nonunique solutions. Optimal estimation (OE) is a widely used physical retrieval method that combines measurements, prior information, and the corresponding uncertainties based on Bayes's theorem to find an optimal solution for the atmospheric state. Furthermore, OE also allows the relative contributions of the different sources of error to the uncertainty in the final retrieved atmospheric state to be understood. Here, we provide a novel Python library to illustrate the use of OE for inverse problems in the atmospheric sciences. We introduce two example problems: how to retrieve drop size distribution parameters from radar observations and how to retrieve the temperature profile from ground-based microwave sensors. Using these examples, we discuss common pitfalls, how the various error sources impact the retrieval, and how the quality of the retrieval results can be quantified.},

  abstract = {The H2O abundance of a planetary atmosphere is a powerful indicator of formation conditions. Inferring H2O in the solar system giant planets is challenging, due to condensation depleting the upper atmosphere of water vapor. Substantially warmer hot Jupiter exoplanets readily allow detections of H2O via transmission spectroscopy, but such signatures are often diminished by the presence of clouds composed of other species. In contrast, highly scattering water clouds can brighten planets in reflected light, enhancing molecular signatures. Here, we present an extensive parameter space survey of the prominence of H2O absorption features in reflection spectra of cool (Teff{$<$}400 K) giant exoplanetary atmospheres. The impact of effective temperature, gravity, metallicity, and sedimentation efficiency is explored. We find prominent H2O features around 0.94 {$\mu$}m, 0.83 {$\mu$}m, and across a wide spectral region from 0.4 to 0.73 {$\mu$}m. The 0.94 {$\mu$}m feature is only detectable where high-altitude water clouds brighten the planet: Teff{$\sim$}150 K, g20 ms-2, fsed3, m10{\texttimes}solar. In contrast, planets with g20 ms-2 and Teff180 K display substantially prominent H2O features embedded in the Rayleigh scattering slope from 0.4 to 0.73 {$\mu$}m over a wide parameter space. High fsed enhances H2O features around 0.94 {$\mu$}m, and enables these features to be detected at lower temperatures. High m results in dampened H2O absorption features, due to water vapor condensing to form bright, optically thick clouds that dominate the continuum. We verify these trends via self-consistent modeling of the low-gravity exoplanet HD 192310c, revealing that its reflection spectrum is expected to be dominated by H2O absorption from 0.4 to 0.73 {$\mu$}m for m10{\texttimes}solar. Our results demonstrate that H2O is manifestly detectable in reflected light spectra of cool giant planets only marginally warmer than Jupiter, providing an avenue to directly constrain the C/O and O/H ratios of a hitherto unexplored population of exoplanetary atmospheres.},

Near-infrared observations show a spectrum with strong methane and water-vapor absorption.

It combines a very high-order adaptive optics system, a diffraction-suppressing coronagraph, and an integral field spectrograph with low spectral resolution but high spatial resolution. Every aspect of the Gemini Planet Imager has been tuned for maximum sensitivity to faint planets near bright stars. During first-light observations, we achieved an estimated H band Strehl ratio of 0.89 and a 5-{$\sigma$} contrast of 106 at 0.75 arcseconds and 105 at 0.35 arcseconds.

Beta Pictoris b is observed at a separation of 434 {\textpm} 6 milliarcseconds (mas) and position angle 211.8 {\textpm} 0.5{$^\circ$}. Fitting the Keplerian orbit of Beta Pic b using the new position together with previous astrometry gives a factor of 3 improvement in most parameters over previous solutions. The planet orbits at a semimajor axis of 9.0-0.4+0.8{\enspace}AU near the 3:2 resonance with the previously known 6-AU asteroidal belt and is aligned with the inner warped disk.

  abstract = {Atmospheric chemical abundances of giant planets lead to important constraints on planetary formation and migration. Studies have shown that giant planets that migrate through the protoplanetary disc can accrete substantial amounts of oxygen-rich planetesimals, leading to supersolar metallicities in the envelope and solar or subsolar C/O ratios. Pebble accretion has been demonstrated to play an important role in core accretion and to have growth rates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble accretion rates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 au and subsequently migrate to cold ( 1 au), warm ({$\sim$}0.1--1 au) or hot ( 0.1 au) orbits. In this work we investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble accretion influences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that under the standard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from the envelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are subsolar, while the C/O ratios are supersolar. Planets that migrate through the disc to become hot Jupiters accrete substantial amounts of water vapour, but still acquire slightly subsolar O/H and supersolar C/O of 0.7--0.8. The metallicity can be substantially subsolar ({$\sim$}0.2--0.5 {\texttimes} solar) and the C/O can even approach 1.0 if the planet accretes its envelope mostly beyond the CO2 ice line, i.e. cold Jupiters or hot Jupiters that form far out and migrate in by scattering. Allowing for core erosion yields significantly supersolar metallicities and solar or subsolar C/O, which can also be achieved by other means, e.g. photoevaporation and late-stage planetesimal accretion.},

  abstract = {Exoplanetary science is on the verge of an unprecedented revolution. The thousands of exoplanets discovered over the past decade have most recently been supplemented by discoveries of potentially habitable planets around nearby low-mass stars. Currently, the field is rapidly progressing toward detailed spectroscopic observations to characterize the atmospheres of these planets. Various surveys from space and the ground are expected to detect numerous more exoplanets orbiting nearby stars that make the planets conducive for atmospheric characterization. The current state of this frontier of exoplanetary atmospheres may be summarized as follows. ▪ We have entered the era of comparative exoplanetology thanks to high-fidelity atmospheric observations now available for tens of exoplanets. ▪ Recent studies reveal a rich diversity of chemical compositions and atmospheric processes hitherto unseen in the Solar System. ▪ Elemental abundances of exoplanetary atmospheres place important constraints on exoplanetary formation and migration histories. ▪ Upcoming observational facilities promise to revolutionize exoplanetary spectroscopy down to rocky exoplanets. ▪ The detection of a biosignature in an exoplanetary atmosphere is conceivable over the next decade. In the present review, we discuss the modern and future landscape of this frontier area of exoplanetary atmospheres. We start with a brief review of the area, emphasising the key insights gained from different observationalmethods and theoretical studies. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of the state of the art, challenges, and future prospects in three forefront branches of the area.},

Fluorine was measured through the synthesis of the available HF lines. We adopted the recent set of experimental molecular parameters of HF delivered by the HITRAN database, and found a new solar fluorine abundance of A(F) = 4.40 {\textpm} 0.25, in good agreement with the M67 average fluorine abundance of A(F) = 4.49 {\textpm} 0.20. The new solar abundance is in a very good agreement with the meteoritic value. The modern spectrosynthesis tools used and the agreement with the meteoritic value and with the results in open cluster M67, known to be a solar analogue, make our solar determination very robust. At the same time, the fluorine measurement in the above-mentioned open clusters is the first step toward understanding its evolution during the last {$\sim$}10 Gyr in the Galactic disk. In order to develop this project, a larger sample of open clusters is required, in order to allow us to trace the evolution of fluorine as a function of time and, in turn, to better understand its origin.},

  abstract = {Discovering wide companions of stellar systems allows us to constrain the dynamical environment and age of the latter. We studied four probable wide companions of four different stellar systems. The candidates were selected mainly based on their similar kinematic properties to the central star using Gaia DR2. The central stars are V4046 Sgr, HIP 74865, HIP 65426, and HIP 73145, and their probable wide companions are 2MASS J18152222-3249329, 2MASS J15174874-3028484, 2MASS J13242119-5129503, and 2MASS J14571503-3543505 respectively. V4046 Sgr is a member of {$\beta$}-Pictoris Moving Group while the rest of the stellar systems are acknowledged as members of the Scorpius-Centaurus association. The selected stellar systems are particularly interesting because all of them are already known to possess a low-mass companion and/or a spatially resolved disk. Identifying wider companions of these stars can improve their eligibility as benchmarks for understanding the formation channels of various triple systems, and can help us to determine the orbits of their possibly undiscovered inner, wider companions in case of higher multiplicity. By analyzing the X-shooter spectra of the wide companion candidates of these stars, we obtained their stellar parameters and determined their ages. We find that 2MASS J15174874-3028484 (0.11 M , 7.4 {\textpm} 0.5 Myr), an already recognized pre-main sequence (PMS) member of ScorpiusCentaurus association, is a highly probable wide companion of HIP 74865. 2MASS J13242119-5129503 (0.04 M , 16 {\textpm} 2.2 Myr) is ruled out as a plausible wide companion of HIP 65426, but confirmed to be a new sub-stellar member of the Scorpius-Centaurus association. 2MASS J14571503-3543505 (0.02 M , 17.75 {\textpm} 4.15 Myr) is a probable sub-stellar member of the same association, but we cannot confirm whether or not it is gravitationally bound to HIP 73145. 2MASS J18152222-3249329 (0.3 M , older than 150 Myr) is determined to be a mildly active main sequence star, much older than members of {$\beta$}-Pictoris Moving Group, and unbound to V4046 Sgr despite their similar kinematic features. PMS wide companions such as 2MASS J15174874-3028484 might have formed through cascade fragmentation of their natal molecular core, hinting at high multiplicity in shorter separations which can be confirmed with future observations.},

  abstract = {We characterize twelve young stellar objects (YSOs) located in the Lupus I region, spatially overlapping with the Upper Centaurus Lupus (UCL) sub-stellar association. The aim of this study is to understand whether the Lupus I cloud has more members than what has been claimed so far in the literature and gain a deeper insight into the global properties of the region. We selected our targets using the Gaia DR2 catalog based on their consistent kinematic properties with the Lupus I bona fide members. In our sample of twelve YSOs observed by X-shooter, we identified ten Lupus I members. We could not determine the membership status of two of our targets, namely Gaia DR2 6014269268967059840 and 2MASS J15361110-3444473 due to technical issues. We found out that four of our targets are accretors, among them, 2MASS J15551027-3455045, with a mass of {$\sim$}0.03 M , is one of the least massive accretors in the Lupus complex identified to date. Several of our targets (including accretors) are formed in situ and off-cloud with respect to the main filaments of Lupus I; hence, our study may hint that there are diffused populations of M dwarfs around Lupus I main filaments. In this context, we would like to emphasize that our kinematic analysis with Gaia catalogs played a key role in identifying the new members of the Lupus I cloud.},

We present the MIRI coronagraphic imaging of the system HD 95086 obtained with the F1065C, F1140, and F2300C filters at central wavelengths of 10.575 {\textmu}m, 11.3 {\textmu}m, and 23 {\textmu}m, respectively. We explored the method for subtracting the stellar diffraction pattern in the particular case when bright dust emitting at short separation is present. Furthermore, we compared different methods for extracting the photometry of the planet. Using the atmospheric models Exo-REM and ATMO, we measured the atmospheric parameters of HD 95086 b. Results. The planet HD 95086 b is detected at the two shortest MIRI wavelengths F1065C and F1140C. The contribution from the inner disk of the system is also detected. It is similar to that in the HR 8799 system. The outer colder belt is imaged at 23 {\textmu}m. Background objects are observed in all filters. The mid-infrared photometry provides better constraints on the atmospheric parameters. We evaluate a temperature of 850 -- 1020 K, consistent with one previous hypothesis that only used near-infrared data. The radius measurement of 1.0 -- 1.13 RJup is better aligned with evolutionary models, but still smaller than predicted. These observations allow us to refute the hypothesis of a warm circumplanetary disk. Conclusions. HD 95086 is one of the first exoplanetary systems to be revealed at mid-infrared wavelengths. This highlights the interests and challenges of observations at these wavelengths.},

  abstract = {The large relative sizes of circumstellar and circumplanetary disks imply that they might be seen in eclipse in stellar light curves. We estimate that a survey of {$\sim$}104 young ({$\sim$}10 million year old) post-accretion pre-main-sequence stars monitored for {$\sim$}10 years should yield at least a few deep eclipses from circumplanetary disks and disks surrounding low-mass companion stars. We present photometric and spectroscopic data for a pre-main-sequence K5 star (1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 = ASAS J140748-3945.7), a newly discovered {$\sim$}0.9 M member of the {$\sim$}16 Myr old Upper Centaurus--Lupus subgroup of Sco-Cen at a kinematic distance of 128 {\textpm} 13 pc. This star exhibited a remarkably long, deep, and complex eclipse event centered on 2007 April 29 (as discovered in Super Wide Angle Search for Planets (SuperWASP) photometry, and with portions of the dimming confirmed by All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) data). At least five multi-day dimming events of {$>$}0.5 mag are identified, with a {$>$}3.3 mag deep eclipse bracketed by two pairs of {$\sim$}1 mag eclipses symmetrically occurring {\textpm}12 days and {\textpm}26 days before and after. Hence, significant dimming of the star was taking place on and off over at least a {$\sim$}54 day period in 2007, and a strong {$>$}1 mag dimming event occurring over a {$\sim$}12 day span. We place a firm lower limit on the period of 850 days (i.e., the orbital radius of the eclipser must be {$>$}1.7 AU and orbital velocity must be {$<$}22 km s-1). The shape of the light curve is similar to the lopsided eclipses of the Be star EE Cep. We suspect that this new star is being eclipsed by a low-mass object orbited by a dense inner disk, further girded by at least three dusty rings of optical depths near unity. Between these rings are at least two annuli of near-zero optical depth (i.e., gaps), possibly cleared out by planets or moons, depending on the nature of the secondary. For possible periods in the range 2.33--200 yr, the estimated total ring mass is {$\sim$}8--0.4 MMoon (if the rings have optical opacity similar to Saturn's rings), and the edge of the outermost detected ring has orbital radius {$\sim$}0.4--0.09 AU. In the new era of time-domain astronomy opened by surveys like SuperWASP, ASAS, etc., and soon to be revolutionized by Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, discovering and characterizing eclipses by circumplanetary and circumsecondary disks will provide us with observational constraints on the conditions that spawn satellite systems around gas giant planets and planetary systems around stars.},

  abstract = {Spectra of young benchmark brown dwarfs with well-known ages are vital to characterize other brown dwarfs, for which ages are in general not known. These spectra are also crucial to test atmospheric models, which have the potential to provide detailed information about the atmospheres of these objects. However, to test atmospheric models optimally, medium-resolution, long-wavelength-coverage spectra with well-understood uncertainties are ideal, such as the spectra provided by the NIRSpec instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope. In this paper, we present medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra of two young brown dwarfs, TWA 28 (M9.0) and TWA 27A (M9.0), and one planetary-mass object, TWA 27B (L6.0), members of the TW Hydrae Association (age {$\sim$} 10 Myr). We show the richness of the atomic lines and molecular bands present in the spectra. All objects show signs of a circumstellar disk, via a near-infrared excess and/or via emission lines. We matched a set of cloudless atmospheric spectra (ATMO), and cloudy atmospheric spectra (BT-Settl) to our NIRSpec spectra, and analyzed which wavelength ranges and spectral features both models reproduce best. Both models derive consistent parameters for the three sources, and predict the existence of CH4 at 3.35 {$\mu$}m in TWA 27B. Nonetheless, in contrast to other slightly older objects with similar spectral type, like PSO 318.5--22 and VHS 1256b, this feature is not present in the spectrum of TWA 27B. The lack of the CH4 feature might suggest that the L--T transition of very young dwarfs starts at later spectral types than for older brown dwarfs.},

  abstract = {This study deals with the TP-AGB phase of low and intermediate-mass stars (0.7{$<$}=M/Msun\_{$<$}=5). To this aim, a semi-analytical model is constructed. A representative set of TP-AGB evolutionary models is calculated for two classes of initial metallicity (Z=0.02 and Z=0.008). A detailed analysis is performed to estimate the changes in the surface chemical composition caused by (1) the inter-shell nucleosynthesis and convective dredge-up; (2) nuclear burning in the deepest layers of the convective envelope; and (3) mass loss by stellar wind. The evolution of the abundances of 13 chemical elements (H, {\textasciicircum}3{\textasciicircum}He, {\textasciicircum}4{\textasciicircum}He, {\textasciicircum}12{\textasciicircum}C, {\textasciicircum}13{\textasciicircum}C, {\textasciicircum}14{\textasciicircum}N, {\textasciicircum}15{\textasciicircum}N, {\textasciicircum}16{\textasciicircum}O, {\textasciicircum}17{\textasciicircum}O,{\textasciicircum}18{\textasciicircum}O, {\textasciicircum}20{\textasciicircum}Ne, {\textasciicircum}22{\textasciicircum}Ne, {\textasciicircum}25{\textasciicircum}Mg) is followed. In particular, the formation of carbon stars is investigated. We use the observed luminosity function of carbon stars in the LMC as the constraint whose fulfillment determines the values of the parameters adopted in the model, namely: the minimum core mass for dredge-up M\_c\_{\textasciicircum}min{\textasciicircum} and the efficiency of the third dredge-up {$\lambda$}. In this way, we derive a proper calibration which the reliability of the chemical analysis stands on. We calculate the stellar yields for both metallicities to provide new data for these key-ingredients in the process of chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium. The chemical composition of PNe is derived and compared to the latest experimental data both in the Galaxy and in the LMC, which leads to a partial agreement. Observed information on the correlation between luminosity and pulsational period of Mira and OH/IR variables is used to test further our results. Finally, we predict the initial-final mass relation and we compare it to the semi-empirically determined one for the solar neighbourhood. The agreement turns out to be satisfactory.},

  abstract = {In this paper we focus on the TP-AGB evolution of intermediate-mass stars experiencing envelope burning (M=4-5Mo). The approach we have adopted is a semi-analytical one as it combines analytical relationships derived from complete models of TP-AGB stars with sole envelope models in which the physical structure is calculated from the photosphere down to the core. Our efforts are directed to analyse the effects produced by envelope burning, such as: i) the energy contribution which may drive significant deviations from the standard core mass-luminosity relationship; and ii) the changes in the surface chemical composition due to nuclear burning via the CNO cycle. Evolutionary models for stars with initial mass of 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 Mo and two choices of the initial chemical composition ([Y=0.28,Z=0.02] and [Y=0.25,Z=0.008]) are calculated from the first thermal pulse till the complete ejection of the envelope. We find that massive TP-AGB stars can rapidly reach high luminosities (-6{$>$}Mbol{$>$}-7), without exceeding, however, the classical limit to the AGB luminosity of Mbol{\textasciitilde}-7.1 corresponding to the Chandrasekhar value of the core mass. No carbon stars brighter than Mbol{\textasciitilde}-6.5 are predicted to form (the alternative of a possible transition from M-star to C-star during the final pulses is also explored), in agreement with observations which indicate that most of the very luminous AGB stars are oxygen-rich. Finally, new chemical yields from stars in the mass range 4-5 Mo are presented, so as to extend the sets of stellar yields from low-mass stars already calculated by Marigo et al. (1996). For each CNO element we give both the secondary and the primary components.},

  abstract = {The optical and infrared colors of L and T dwarfs are sensitive to cloud sedimentation and chemical equilibrium processes in their atmospheres. The i{$\prime$}-z{$\prime$} versus J-K color-color diagram provides a window into diverse atmospheric processes mainly because different chemical processes govern each color, and cloud opacity largely affects J-K but not i{$\prime$}-z{$\prime$}. Using theoretical atmosphere models that include for the first time a self-consistent treatment of cloud formation, we present an interpretation of the i{$\prime$}-z{$\prime$} versus J-K color trends of known L and T dwarfs. We find that the i{$\prime$}-z{$\prime$} color is extremely sensitive to chemical equilibrium assumptions; chemical equilibrium models accounting for cloud sedimentation predict redder i{$\prime$}-z{$\prime$} colors---by up to 2 mag---than models that neglect sedimentation. We explore the previously known J-K color trends in which objects first become redder, then bluer with decreasing effective temperature. Only models that include sedimentation of condensates are able to reproduce these trends. We find that the exact track of a cooling brown dwarf in J-K (and i{$\prime$}-z{$\prime$}) is very sensitive to the details of clouds, in particular to the efficiency of sedimentation of condensates in its atmosphere. We also find that clouds still affect the strength of the J-, H-, and K-band fluxes of even the coolest T dwarfs. In addition, we predict the locus in the i{$\prime$}-z{$\prime$} versus J-K color-color diagram of brown dwarfs cooler than yet discovered.},

Imaging detections are challenging because of the combined effect of small angular separation and large luminosity contrast between a planet and its host star. High-contrast observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes have revealed three planets orbiting the star HR 8799, with projected separations of 24, 38, and 68 astronomical units. Multi-epoch data show counter clockwise orbital motion for all three imaged planets. The low luminosity of the companions and the estimated age of the system imply planetary masses between 5 and 13 times that of Jupiter. This system resembles a scaled-up version of the outer portion of our solar system.},

  abstract = {We have reanalyzed archival HST and Subaru data of the recently discovered planetary mass companion (PMC) GQ Lup B. With these we produce the first R- and I-band photometry of the companion and fit a radius and effective temperature using detailed model atmospheres. We find an effective temperature of 2335 {\textpm} 100 K, a radius of 0.38 {\textpm} 0.05 R{$\Sun$}, and a luminosity of log(L/L{$\Sun$}) = -2.42 {\textpm} 0.07 (at 140 pc). Since we fit wavelengths that span most of the emitted radiation from GQ Lup, this luminosity estimate is robust, with uncertainty dominated by the distance uncertainty ({\textpm}50 pc). The radius obtained for 140 pc (0.38 R{$\Sun$}) is significantly larger than the one originally derived and larger than model predictions. The mass of the object is much more model-dependent than the radiative properties, but for the Gaia dusty models we find a mass between 10MJup and 20MJup, in the range of the brown dwarf and PMC deuterium-burning boundary. Assuming a distance of 140 pc, observations fit to 1 {$\sigma$} the Baraffe evolution model for an 15MJup brown dwarf. Additionally, the F606W photometric band is significantly overluminous compared to model predictions and other brown dwarfs. Such overluminosity could be explained by a bright H{$\alpha$} emission from chromospheric activity, interaction with another undetected companion, or accretion. Assuming that GQ Lup B has a bright H{$\alpha$} emission line, its H{$\alpha$} emission strength is 10-1.71{\textpm}0.10Lbol, significantly larger than field late-type dwarfs. GQ Lup B might be strongly accreting and might still be in its formation phase.},

  abstract = {ASASSN-21qj is a distant Sun-like star that recently began an episode of deep dimming events after no prior recorded variability. Here we examine archival and newly obtained optical and near-infrared data of this star. The deep aperiodic dimming and absence of previous infrared excess are reminiscent of KIC 8462852 (``Boyajian's Star''). The observed occultations are consistent with a circumstellar cloud of submicron-sized dust grains composed of amorphous pyroxene, with a minimum mass of 1.50 {\textpm} 0.04 {\texttimes} 10-9 M {$\oplus$} derived from the deepest occultations, and a minimum grain size of assuming a power-law size distribution. We further identify the first evidence of near-infrared excess in this system from NEOWISE 3.4 and 4.6 {$\mu$}m observations. The excess emission implies a total circumstellar dust mass of around 10-6 M {$\oplus$}, comparable to the extreme, variable disks associated with terrestrial planet formation around young stars. The quasiperiodic recurrence of deep dips and the inferred dust temperature (ranging from 1800 to 700 K across the span of observations) independently point to an orbital distance of {$\simeq$}0.2 au for the dust, supporting the occulting material and excess emission being causally linked. The origin of this extended, opaque cloud is surmised to be the breakup of one or more exocometary bodies.},

In our ongoing effort to leverage the extraordinary sensitivity of the Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 {$\mu$}m to study wide planetary-mass and substellar companions near the diffraction limit, we present point-spread function fitting photometry of archival Spitzer/IRAC images for nine stars (G0 to M4+M7) in nearby star-forming regions or stellar associations that host companions at separations of {$\rho$} = 1.{${''}$}17--12.{${''}$}33. We detect all system primaries in all four IRAC channels and recover eight low-mass companions in at least one IRAC channel for our sample, five of which have not been resolved previously in IRAC images. We measure nonphotospheric [3.6]--[8.0] colors for four of the system companions (DH Tau B, 2M0441 B, SR 12 c, and ROXs 42B b), confirming or discovering the presence of circumstellar or circum(sub)stellar disks. We detect fluxes consistent with photospheric emission for four other companions (AB Pic b, CHXR 73 b, 1RXS J1609 b, and HD 203030 b) that are unlikely to host disks. Combined with past detections of accretion or disk indicators, we determine the global disk frequency of young ({$<$}15 Myr) wide companions with masses near the deuterium-burning limit to be 56\% {\textpm} 12\%.},

Specifically, we use an established set of spectral indices to determine surface gravity classifications for all of the M6--L7 objects in our sample by measuring the equivalent widths (EW) of the K I lines at 1.1692, 1.1778, and 1.2529 {$\mu$}m, and the 1.2 {$\mu$}m FeHJ absorption index. Our results are consistent with previous surface gravity measurements, showing a distinct double peak---at {$\sim$}L5 and T5---in K I EW as a function of spectral type. We analyze the K I EWs of 73 objects of known ages and find a linear trend between log(Age) and EW. From this relationship, we assign age ranges to the very low gravity, intermediate gravity, and field gravity designations for spectral types M6--L0. Interestingly, the ages probed by these designations remain broad, change with spectral type, and depend on the gravity-sensitive index used. Gravity designations are useful indicators of the possibility of youth, but current data sets cannot be used to provide a precise age estimate.},

The sample is mainly composed of low-activity, main-sequence late-A to mid-M-type stars. We performed a search for short (days) and long-term (years) periodic variations in the photometry. We modelled the light curves with combinations of sinusoids to measure the properties of these periodic signals. To provide a better statistical interpretation of our results, we complement our new results with results from previous similar works.\emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}We have been able to measure long-term photometric cycles of 47 stars, out of which 39 have been derived with false alarm probabilities (FAP) of less than 0.1 per cent. Rotational modulation was also detected and rotational periods were measured in 36 stars. For 28 stars we have simultaneous measurements of activity cycles and rotational periods, 17 of which are M-type stars. We measured both photometric amplitudes and periods from sinusoidal fits. The measured cycle periods range from 2 to 14 yr with photometric amplitudes in the range of 5-20 mmag. We found that the distribution of cycle lengths for the different spectral types is similar, as the mean cycle is 9.5 yr for F-type stars, 6.7 yr for G-type stars, 8.5 yr for K-type stars, 6.0 yr for early M-type stars, and 7.1 yr for mid-M-type stars. On the other hand, the distribution of rotation periods is completely different, trending to longer periods for later type stars, from a mean rotation of 8.6 days for F-type stars to 85.4 days in mid-M-type stars. The amplitudes induced by magnetic cycles and rotation show a clear correlation. A trend of photometric amplitudes with rotation period is also outlined in the data. The amplitudes of the photometric variability induced by activity cycles of main-sequence GK stars are lower than those of early- and mid-M dwarfs for a given activity index. Using spectroscopic data, we also provide an update in the empirical relationship between the level of chromospheric activity as given by log\textsubscript{10{$<$}sub/{$>$}\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} '\textsubscript{HK{$<$}sub/{$>$} and the rotation periods.}}}}}}},

V773 Tau A was phase-referenced to QSO B0400+258. Results. Two distinctive structures appear in the radio images here presented. They happen to be associated with the primary and secondary stars of the V773 Tau A system. In one image (Fig. 2B) the two features are extended up to 18 R{$\ast$} each and are nearly parallel revealing the presence of two interacting helmet streamers. One image (Fig. 2E) taken a few hours after a flare monitored by the 100-m Effelsberg telescope shows one elongated fading structure substantially rotated with respect to those seen in the B run. The same decay scenario is seen in Fig. 2G for the helmet streamer associated with the other star. Conclusions. This is the very first direct evidence revealing that even if the flare origin is magnetic reconnection due to interbinary collision, both stars independently emit in the radio range with structures of their own. These structures are helmet streamers, observed for the first time in stars other than the Sun. The complete extent of each helmet streamer above the stellar surface is about 24 R{$\ast$} which implies that they can practically interact throughout the whole orbit, even rather close to apoastron where the stellar separation is 52 R{$\ast$}. However, the radio flares become stronger when the stars approach. Around periastron the stellar separation is only 30 R{$\ast$}, nearly covered by a single streamer: the two streamers overlap producing the observed giant flares.},

It is assumed that the disk forms by accretion of primordial material coming from outside with a time-scale which is a function of the galactocentric distance. The possibility of forming the disk out of enriched halo gas is also studied in a simple way. The evolution of the abundances of several single elements is predicted as well as that of gas mass, SN rates and star formation rate, both in the solar neighborhood and in the whole disk, under different assumptions for the star formation rate. Abundance gradients along the galactic disk are well reproduced and a possible interpretation for the differences among gradients of different elements is given in terms of nucleosynthesis and stellar lifetimes. This interpretation can represent a key for understanding gradients also in external galaxies. In particular, a natural explanation is suggested for the positive gradient of S/O, found in M101 and M33.},

Minimum outer temperatures range from 30 to 100 K, as expected from studies of the early protosolar nebula and suggested by the modeling of the spectra of protoplanetary disks. The mass of the central star is also varied, although it is usually assumed to be equal to that of the Sun. Overall, the initial disks span minimum Q-parameters between 0.8 and 2, with most models having Q 1.4. The disks are evolved assuming either a locally isothermal equation of state or an adiabatic equation of state with varying {$\gamma$}. Heating by (artificial) viscosity and shocks is included when the adiabatic equation of state is used. When condensations above a specific density threshold appear as a result of gravitational instability in a locally isothermal calculation, the equation of state is switched to adiabatic to account for the increased optical depth. We show that when a disk has a minimum Q-parameter less than 1.4, strong trailing spiral instabilities, typically three- or four-armed modes, form and grow until fragmentation occurs along the arms after about 5 mean disk orbital times. The resulting clumps contract quickly to densities several orders of magnitude higher than the initial disk density, and the densest of them survive even under adiabatic conditions. These clumps are stable to tidal disruption and merge quickly, leaving two to three protoplanets on fairly eccentric orbits (the mean eccentricity being around 0.2) after 103 yr. Fragmentation is not strongly dependent on whether the disk starts from a marginally unstable state or gradually achieves it; we show that if the disk is allowed to grow in mass from a very light, very stable state over tens of orbital times, it still fragments at roughly the same mass and temperature as in the standard disk models. We show that the first stages of the instability, until the appearance of the overdensities, can be understood in terms of the maximum unstable Toomre wavelength and the local Jeans length. A high mass and force resolution are needed to correctly resolve both scales and follow the fragmentation process appropriately. Varying disk mass and temperature affects such physical scales and hence the typical masses of the protoplanets that form. Objects smaller than Saturn or a couple of times bigger than Jupiter can both be produced by fragmentation. Their final masses will then depend on the subsequent interactions and mergers with other clumps and on the accretion of disk material. The accretion rate depends on the disk thermodynamics and is negligible with adiabatic conditions. After 103 yr the masses range from just below 1MJup to more than 7MJup, well in agreement with those of detected extrasolar planets.},

The suite of filters chosen was designed to address a number of scientific questions including the form of the extreme low-mass end of the IMF into the planetary-mass range to 1 Jupiter mass and below; the nature of ionised and non-ionised circumstellar disks and associated proplyds in the near-IR with a similar resolution to prior HST studies; to examine the large fragmented outflow from the embedded BN-KL region at very high resolution and fidelity; and to search for new jets and outflows from young stars in the Trapezium Cluster and the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 behind. In this paper, we present a description of the design of the observational programme, explaining the rationale for the filter set chosen and the telescope and detector modes used to make the survey; the reduction of the data using the JWST pipeline and other tools; the creation of large colour mosaics covering the region; and an overview of the discoveries made in the colour images and in the individual filter mosaics. Highlights include the discovery of large numbers of free-floating planetary-mass candidates as low as 0.6 Jupiter masses, a significant fraction of which are in wide binaries; new emission phenomena associated with the explosive outflow from the BN-KL region; and a mysterious "dark absorber" associated with a number of disparate features in the region, but which is seen exclusively in the F115W filter. Further papers will examine those discoveries and others in more detail.},

This process uses a combination of techniques from the recent literature as well as observations of weak-line T Tauri stars to account for the differences in surface gravity and chromospheric activity between the T Tauri stars and dwarfs, which are typically used as photospheric templates for CTTS. Our improved veiling and extinction estimates for our targets allow us to extract flux-calibrated spectra of the excess in the near-infrared. We find that we are able to produce an acceptable parametric fit to the near-infrared excesses using a combination of up to three blackbodies. In half of our sample, two blackbodies at temperatures of 8000 K and 1600 K suffice. These temperatures and the corresponding solid angles are consistent with emission from the accretion shock on the stellar surface and the inner dust sublimation rim of the disk, respectively. In contrast, the other half requires three blackbodies at 8000, 1800, and 800 K, to describe the excess. We interpret the combined two cooler blackbodies as the dust sublimation wall with either a contribution from the disk surface beyond the wall or curvature of the wall itself, neither of which should have single-temperature blackbody emission. In these fits, we find no evidence of a contribution from optically thick gas inside the inner dust rim.},

  abstract = {We present a sequence of high-resolution (R \$ 20;000, or 15 km s{\`A}1) infrared spectra of stars and brown dwarfs spanning spectral types M2.5 to T6. Observations of 16 objects were obtained using eight echelle orders to cover part of the J band from 1.165Y1.323  m with NIRSPEC on the Keck II telescope. By comparing opacity plots and line lists, over 200 weak features in the J band are identified with either FeH or H2O transitions. Absorption by FeH attains maximum strength in the mid-L dwarfs, while H2O absorption becomes systematically stronger toward later spectral types. Narrow resolved features broaden markedly after the M to L transition. Our high-resolution spectra also reveal that the disappearance of neutral Al lines at the boundary between M and L dwarfs is remarkably abrupt, presumably because of the formation of grains. Neutral Fe lines can be traced to mid-L dwarfs before Fe is removed by condensation. The neutral potassium (K i) doublets that dominate the J band have pressure-broadened wings that continue to broaden from \$50 km s{\`A}1 ( FWHM ) at mid M to \$500 km s{\`A}1 at mid T. In contrast, however, the measured pseudoYequivalent widths of these same lines reach a maximum in the mid-L dwarfs. The young L2 dwarf, G196-3B, exhibits narrow potassium lines without extensive pressure-broadened wings, indicative of a lower gravity atmosphere. Kelu-1AB, another L2, has exceptionally broad infrared lines, including FeH and H2O features, confirming its status as a rapid rotator. In contrast to other late-T objects, the peculiar T6 dwarf 2MASS 0937+29 displays a complete absence of potassium even at high resolution, which may be a metallicity effect or a result of a cooler, higher gravity atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Exoplanets hosting M dwarfs are the best targets to characterize Earth-like or super-Earth planetary atmospheres with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We determine detailed stellar parameters (T eff, logg, and {$\xi$}) and individual abundances of 12 elements for four cool M dwarfs hosting exoplanets TOI-1685, GJ 436, GJ 3470, and TOI-2445, scheduled for future observations by the JWST. The analysis utilizes high-resolution near-infrared spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV APOGEE survey between 1.51 and 1.69 {$\mu$}m. Based on 1D LTE plane-parallel models, we find that TOI-2445 is slightly metal poor ([Fe/H] = -0.16 {\textpm} 0.09 dex), while TOI-1685, GJ 436, and GJ 3470 are more metal rich ([Fe/H] = 0.06 {\textpm} 0.18, 0.10 {\textpm} 0.20, and 0.25 {\textpm} 0.15 dex, respectively). The derived C/O ratios for TOI-2445, TOI-1685, GJ 436, and GJ 3470 are 0.526 {\textpm} 0.027, 0.558 {\textpm} 0.097, 0.561 {\textpm} 0.029, and 0.638 {\textpm} 0.015, respectively. From the results for 28 M dwarfs analyzed homogeneously from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) spectra, we find exoplanet-hosting M dwarfs exhibit a C/O abundance ratio approximately 0.01--0.05 higher than those with nondetected exoplanets, at limits of a statistically significant offset. A linear regression of the [Fe/H] versus C/O distribution reveals a noticeable difference in the angular coefficient between FGK dwarfs (0.27) and M dwarfs (0.13). Assuming our abundance ratios of Ca/Mg, Si/Mg, Al/Mg, and Fe/Mg, we determine a mass of M {$\oplus$} for TOI-2445 b, which has a density (6.793 g cm-3) and core mass fraction (0.329 ) very similar to Earth's. We also present an atlas of 113 well-defined spectral lines to analyze M dwarfs in the H band and a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainties from variations in the atmospheric parameters, signal-to-noise ratio, and pseudocontinuum.},

We search the TESS light curves for transiting planets with orbital periods below 7 days and recover all six known planets within the sample, as well as a likely planet candidate orbiting LHS 475. Each of these planets is consistent with a terrestrial composition, with planet radii between 0.91 and 1.31 R {$\oplus$}. We characterize the transit detection sensitivity for each star as a function of planet radius, insolation, and orbital period. We obtain a cumulative occurrence rate of terrestrial planets per star with radii above 0.5 R {$\oplus$} and orbital periods between 0.4 and 7 days. We find that for comparable insolations, planets larger than 1.5 R {$\oplus$} (sub-Neptunes) are significantly less abundant around mid-to-late M dwarfs compared to earlier-type stars, while the occurrence rate of terrestrial planets is comparable to that of more massive M dwarfs. We estimate that overall, terrestrials outnumber sub-Neptunes around mid-to-late M dwarfs by 14 to 1, in contrast to GK dwarfs, where they are roughly equinumerous. We place a 1{$\sigma$} upper limit of 0.07 planets larger than 1.5 R {$\oplus$} per star within the orbital period range of 0.5--7 days.

  abstract = {Methods. We performed hydrodynamic simulations of M dwarf protostellar discs in order to determine the minimum disc mass required for gravitational fragmentation to occur. Different stellar masses, disc radii, and metallicities were considered. The mass of each protostellar disc was steadily increased until the disc fragmented and a protoplanet was formed. Results. We find that a disc-to-star mass ratio between {$\sim$}0.3 and {$\sim$}0.6 is required for fragmentation to happen. The minimum mass at which a disc fragment increases with the stellar mass and the disc size. Metallicity does not significantly affect the minimum disc fragmentation mass but high metallicity may suppress fragmentation. Protoplanets form quickly (within a few thousand years) at distances around {$\sim$}50 AU from the host star, and they are initially very hot; their centres have temperatures similar to the ones expected at the accretion shocks around planets formed by core accretion (up to 12 000 K). The final properties of these planets (e.g. mass and orbital radius) are determined through long-term disc-planet or planet--planet interactions. Conclusions. Disc instability is a plausible way to form gas giant planets around M dwarfs provided that discs have at least 30\% the mass of their host stars during the initial stages of their formation. Future observations of massive M dwarf discs or planets around very young M dwarfs are required to establish the importance of disc instability for planet formation around low-mass stars.},

Using the direct imaging technique we searched for low mass companions around the star AF Lep that presents a significant proper motion anomaly (PMa) signal obtained from the comparison of Hipparcos and Gaia eDR3 catalogs. Methods. We observed AF Lep in two epochs with VLT/SPHERE using its subsystems IFS and IRDIS in the near-infrared (NIR) covering wavelengths ranging from the Y to the K spectral bands (between 0.95 and 2.3 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m). The data were then reduced using the high-contrast imaging techniques angular differential imaging (ADI) and spectral differential imaging (SDI) to be able to retrieve the signal from low mass companions of the star. Results. A faint companion was retrieved at a separation of {\textasciitilde}0.335" from the star and with a position angle of {\textasciitilde}70.5 deg in the first epoch and with a similar position in the second epoch. This corresponds to a projected separation of {\textasciitilde}9 au. The extracted photometry allowed us to estimate for the companion a mass between 2 and 5 MJup. This mass is in good agreement with what is expected for the dynamic mass of the companion deduced using astrometric measures (5.2-5.5 MJup). This is the first companion with a mass well below the deuterium burning limit discovered coupling direct imaging with PMa measures. Orbit fitting done using the orvara tool allowed to further confirm the companion mass and to define its main orbital parameters.},

We present medium resolution (R~= 350), coronagraphic long-slit spectroscopic observations with SPHERE of two substellar companions, HD\,1160\,B and HD\,19467\,B. We found that HD\,1160\,B has a peculiar spectrum that cannot be fitted by spectra in current spectral libraries. A good fit is possible only considering separately the Y+J and the H spectral band. The spectral type is between M5 and M7. We also estimated a Teff of 2800--2900~K and a log\,g of 3.5--4.0~dex. The low surface gravity seems to favour young age (10--20~Myr) and low mass ({$\sim$}20~MJup\,) for this object. HD\,19467\,B is instead a fully evolved object with a Teff of {$\sim$}1000~K and log\,g of {$\sim$}5.0~dex. Its spectral type is T6~{\textpm}~1.},

  abstract = {The combination of detection techniques enhances our ability to identify companions orbiting nearby stars. We employed high-contrast imaging to constrain mass and separation of possible companions responsible for the significant proper motion anomalies of the nearby stars HIP 11696, HIP 47110 and HIP 36277. These targets were observed using the LBT's high-contrast camera, SHARK-NIR, in H-band using a Gaussian coronagraph, and with the LMIRCam instrument in the L'-band and using a vAPP coronagraph. Both observations were conducted simultaneously. Additionally, constraints at short separations from the host star are derived analyzing the renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) values from the Gaia catalogue. We find that the companion responsible for the anomaly signal of HIP 11696 is likely positioned at a distance from 2.5 to 28 astronomical units from its host. Its mass is estimated to be between 4 and 16 Jupiter masses, with the greater mass possible only at the upper end of the separation range. Similar limits were obtained for HIP 47110 where the companion should reside between 3 and 30 au with a mass between 3 and 10 MJup. For HIP 36277, we identified a faint stellar companion at large separation, though it might be substellar depending on the assumed age for the star. Considering the older age, this object accounts for the absolute value of the PMa vector but not for its direction. Additionally, we found a substellar candidate companion at a closer separation that could explain the PMa signal, considering a younger age for the system.},

Methods: .The models include the same physics, which was applied successfully at the solar Z and for the SMC, in particular, shear diffusion, meridional circulation, horizontal turbulence, and rotationally enhanced mass loss. Results: .Models of very low Z experience a much stronger internal mixing in all phases than at solar Z. Also, rotating models at very low Z, contrary to the usual considerations, show a large mass loss, which mainly results from the efficient mixing of the products of the 3{$\alpha$} reaction into the H-burning shell. This mixing allows convective dredge-up to enrich the stellar surface in heavy elements during the red supergiant phase, which in turn favours a large loss of mass by stellar winds, especially as rotation also increases the duration of this phase. On the whole, the low Z stars may lose about half of their mass. Massive stars initially rotating at half of their critical velocity are likely to avoid the pair-instability supernova. The chemical composition of the rotationally enhanced winds of very low Z stars show large CNO enhancements by factors of 103 to 10{\textasciicircum}7, together with large excesses of 13C and 17O and moderate amounts of Na and Al. The excesses of primary N are particularly striking. When these ejecta from the rotationally enhanced winds are diluted with the supernova ejecta from the corresponding CO cores, we find [C/Fe], [N/Fe], [O/Fe] abundance ratios that are very similar to those observed in the C-rich, extremely metal-poor stars (CEMP). We show that rotating AGB stars and rotating massive stars have about the same effects on the CNO enhancements. Abundances of s-process elements and the 12C/13C ratio could help us to distinguish between contributions from AGB and massive stars. Conclusions: .},

  abstract = {Grids of models for rotating stars are constructed in the range of 9 to 120 Msun at solar metallicity. The following effects of rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations for non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal turbulence, shear instability and coupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion of angular momentum treated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion of the chemical elements. Globally we find that for massive stars the effects of rotation have an importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in 1-2\% of the MS lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then slowly evolves during the MS phase. The circulation shows two main cells. In the deep interior, circulation rises along the polar axis and goes down at the equator, while due to the Gratton-{\"O}pik term it is the inverse in outer layers. This external inverse circulation grows in depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that a stationary approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation would be inappropriate. After the MS phase, the effects of core contraction and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum. The surface velocities decrease very much during the MS evolution of the most massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a lot of angular momentum. This produces some convergence of the velocities, but not necessarily towards the break-up velocities. However, stars with masses below {\textasciitilde} 12 Msun with initially high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near the end of the MS phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some other interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out. For an average rotation, the tracks in the HR diagram are modified like a moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may increase the MS lifetime up to about 30\%; for the helium-burning phase the effects are smaller and amount to at most 10\%. From plots of the isochrones, we find that rotation may increase the age estimate by about 25\% in general. However, for stars with M {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 40 Msun and fast rotation, a bluewards ``homogeneous-like'' track, with important He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting the age estimates for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large scatter in the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g\_eff and log T\_eff, differences of masses by 30\% may easily occur, thus explaining what still remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings significant surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher masses and rotation. While it is not difficult to explain very fast rotators with He- and N-excesses, the present models also well account for the many OB stars exhibiting surface enrichments and moderate or low rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. {\textbackslash}cite\{He92\}, {\textbackslash}cite\{He20\}). These stars likely result from initially fast rotators, which experienced mixing and lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass loss. The comparison of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports the conclusion by Venn ({\textbackslash}cite\{ve95a\}, {\textbackslash}cite\{Ve99\}), that these enrichments mostly result from mixing during the MS phase, which is also in agreement with the results of Lyubimkov ({\textbackslash}cite\{Lyu96\}).},

Star models with initial masses superior or equal to 9 M were computed up to the end of the carbon--burning phase. Star models with masses between 2 and 7 M were evolved beyond the end of the He--burning phase through a few thermal pulses during the AGB phase. Compared to models at Z = 0.02, the low Z models show faster rotating cores and stronger internal {\textohm}--gradients, which favour an important mixing of the chemical elements. The enhancement of N/C at the surface may reach 2 to 3 orders of magnitude for fast rotating stars. Surface enrichments may make the evolved stars less metal poor than they were initially. In very low Z models, primary nitrogen is produced during the He--burning phase by rotational diffusion of 12C into the H--burning shell. A large fraction of the primary 14N escapes further destruction and enters the envelope of AGB stars, being ejected during the TP--AGB phase and the formation of a planetary nebula. The intermediate mass stars of very low Z are the main producers of primary 14N, but massive stars also contribute to this production; no significant primary nitrogen is made in models at metallicity Z = 0.004 or above. We calculate the chemical yields in He, C, N, O and heavy elements and discuss the chemical evolution of the CNO elements at very low Z. Remarkably, the C/O vs. O/H diagram is mainly sensitive to the interval of stellar masses, while the N/O vs. O/H diagram is mainly sensitive to the average rotation of the stars contributing to the element synthesis. The presently available observations in these diagrams seem to favour contributions either from stars down to about 2 M with normal rotation velocities or from stars above 8 M but with very fast rotation.},

In addition, no seasonal variability of the thermal structure has been observed on Uranus since Voyager 2 era and significant subseasonal variations have been revealed on Neptune. In this paper, we evaluate different realistic heat sources that can induce sufficient heating to warm the atmosphere of these planets and we estimate the seasonal effects on the thermal structure. The seasonal radiative-convective model developed by the Laboratoire de M{\textbackslash}'et{\textbackslash}'eorologie Dynamique is used to reproduce the thermal structure of these planets. Three hypotheses for the heating sources are explored separately: aerosol layers, a higher methane mole fraction, and thermospheric conduction. Our modelling indicates that aerosols with plausible scattering properties can produce the requisite heating for Uranus, but not for Neptune. Alternatively, greater stratospheric methane abundances can provide the missing heating on both planets, but the large values needed are inconsistent with current observational constraints. In contrast, adding thermospheric conduction cannot warm alone the stratosphere of both planets. The combination of these heat sources is also investigated. In the upper troposphere of both planets, the meridional thermal structures produced by our model are found inconsistent with those retrieved from Voyager 2/IRIS data. Furthermore, our models predict seasonal variations should exist within the stratospheres of both planets while observations showed that Uranus seems to be invariant to meridional contrasts and only subseasonal temperature trends are visible on Neptune. However, a warm south pole is seen in our simulations of Neptune as observed since 2003.},

  abstract = {Spectroscopic studies of the upper atmospheres of the giant planets using infrared wavelengths sensitive to the H3+ molecular ion show that this species plays a critical role in determining the physical conditions there. For Jupiter, we propose that the recently detected H3+ electrojet holds the key to the mechanism by which the equatorial plasma sheet is kept in (partial) co-rotation with the planet, and that this mechanism also provides a previously unconsidered source of energy that helps explain why the jovian thermosphere is considerably hotter than expected. For Saturn, we show that the H3+ auroral emission is ca.1\% of that of Jupiter because of the lower ionospheric/thermospheric temperature and the lower flux of ionizing particles precipitated there; it is probably unnecessary to invoke additional chemistry in the auroral/polar regions. For Uranus, we report further evidence that its emission intensity is controlled by the cycle of solar activity. And we propose that H3+ emission may just be detectable using current technology from some of the giant extra-solar planets that have been detected orbiting nearby stars, such as Tau Bootes.},

  abstract = {Methods. The isotope-selective photodissociation, the main process controlling the abundances of CO isotopologues in the CO-emissive layer, is properly treated for the first time in a full-disk model. The chemistry, thermal balance, line, and continuum radiative transfer are all considered together with a chemical network that treats 13CO, C18O and C17O, isotopes of all included atoms and molecules as independent species. Results. Isotope selective processes lead to regions in the disk where the isotopologue abundance ratios of C18O/12CO, for example, are considerably different from the elemental 18O/16O ratio. The results of this work show that considering CO isotopologue ratios as constants can lead to underestimating disk masses by up to an order of magnitude or more if grains have grown to larger sizes. This may explain observed discrepancies in mass determinations from different tracers. The dependence of the various isotopologue emission on stellar and disk parameters is investigated to set the framework for the analysis of ALMA data. Conclusions. Including CO isotope selective processes is crucial for determining the gas mass of the disk accurately (through ALMA observations) and thus for providing the amount of gas that may eventually form planets or change the dynamics of forming planetary systems.},

So far, most FFPs have been discovered using indirect methods; microlensing surveys have proved particularly successful to detect these objects down to a few Earth masses1,2. However, the ephemeral nature of microlensing events prevents any follow-up observations and individual characterization. Several studies have identified FFPs in young stellar clusters3,4 and the Galactic field5 but their samples are small or heterogeneous in age and origin. Here we report the discovery of between 70 and 170 FFPs (depending on the assumed age) in the region encompassing Upper Scorpius and Ophiuchus, the closest young OB association to the Sun. We found an excess of FFPs by a factor of up to seven compared with core-collapse model predictions6--8, demonstrating that other formation mechanisms may be at work. We estimate that ejection from planetary systems might have a contribution comparable to that of core collapse in the formation of FFPs. Therefore, ejections due to dynamical instabilities in giant exoplanet systems must be frequent within the first 10\,Myr of a system's life.},

Predissociation lifetimes are determined by discretizing continuum states in the variational method nuclear motion calculation by restricting the calculation to a finite range of internuclear separations. Varying this range gives a series of avoided crossings between quasi-bound states associated with the A 2{$\Sigma$}+ and continuum states, from which predissociation lifetimes are extracted. 424 quasi-bound A 2{$\Sigma$}+ state rovibronic energy levels are analyzed, and 374 predissociation lifetimes are produced, offering good coverage of the predissociation region. Agreement with measured lifetimes is satisfactory, and a majority of computed results were within experimental uncertainty. A previously unreported A 2{$\Sigma$}+ state predissociation channel that goes via X 2{$\Pi$} is identified in the calculations. A Python package, binSLT, produced to calculate predissociation lifetimes, associated line broadening parameters, and lifetime uncertainties is made available. The PECs and other curves from this work will be used to produce a rovibronic ExoMol line list and temperature-dependent photodissociation cross sections for the hydroxyl radical.},

They are likely second generation stars and the few elements measurable in their atmospheres are used to infer the properties of single or very few progenitors. The high carbon abundance in the CEMP-no stars offers a unique opportunity to measure the carbon isotopic ratio, which directly monitors the presence of mixing between the He and H-burning layers either within the star or in the progenitor(s). By means of high-resolution spectra acquired with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT we aim to derive values for the 12C/13C ratio at the lowest metallicities. A spectral synthesis technique based on the SYNTHE code and on ATLAS models is used within a Markov-chain Monte Carlo methodology to derive 12C/13C in the stellar atmospheres of five of the most metal poor stars. These are the Mega Metal-Poor giant SMS J0313-6708 ([Fe/H]{$<$}-7.1), the Hyper Metal-Poor dwarf HE1327-2326 ([Fe/H]=-5.8),the Hyper Metal-Poor giant SDSS J1313-0019 ([Fe/H] = -5.0) and the Ultra Metal-Poor subgiant HE0233-0343 ([Fe/H]=-4.7). We also revise a previous value for the Mega Metal-Poor giant SMSS J1605-1443 with ([Fe/H] = -6.2). In four stars we derive an isotopic value while for HE1327-2326 we provide a lower limit. All Measurements are in the range 39{$<$}12C/13C{$<$}100 showing that the He- and H-burning layers underwent partial mixing either in the stars or, more likely, in their progenitors. This provides evidence of a primary production of 13C at the dawn of chemical evolution. [abridged]},

  abstract = {Methods. High-dispersion (R = 100 000) thermal emission spectra, and in some cases reflection spectra, were simulated by selfconsistent modeling of the atmospheric structures and abundances of exoplanets over a wide range of effective temperatures. These were synthetically observed with a telescope equivalent to the VLT and/or ELT, and analyzed using the cross-correlation technique, resulting in signal-to-noise ratio predictions for the 13CO, HDO, and CH3D isotopologues. Results. We find that for the best observable exoplanets, 13CO is well in range of current telescopes. We predict it will be most favorably detectable at 2.4 {\textmu}m, just longward of the wavelength regions probed by several high-dispersion spectroscopic observations presented in the literature. CH3D can be best targeted at 4.7 {\textmu}m, and may be detectable using 40 m-class telescopes for planets below 600 K in equilibrium temperature. In this case, the sky background becomes the dominating noise source for self-luminous planets. HDO is best targeted at 3.7 {\textmu}m, and is less affected by sky background noise. 40 m-class telescopes may lead to its detection for planets with Tequ below 900 K. It could already be in the range of current 8 m-class telescopes in the case of quenched methane abundances. Finally, if Proxima Cen b is water-rich, the HDO isotopologue could be detected with the ELT in {$\sim$}1 night of observing time in its reflected-light spectrum. Conclusions. Isotopologues will soon be a part of the exoplanet characterisation tools. Measuring D/H in exoplanets, and ratios of other isotopes, could become a prime science case for the first-light instrument METIS on the European ELT, especially for nearby temperate rocky and ice giant planets. This can provide unique insights in their history of icy-body enrichment and atmospheric evaporation processes.},

Existing studies commonly try to constrain atmospheric abundances, or to analyze what abundance patterns a given description of planet formation predicts. However, there is also a pressing need to develop methodologies that investigate how to transform atmospheric compositions into planetary formation inferences. In this study we summarize the complexities and uncertainties of state-of-the-art planet formation models and how they influence planetary atmospheric compositions. We introduce a methodology that explores the effect of different formation model assumptions when interpreting atmospheric compositions. We apply this framework to the directly imaged planet HR 8799e. Based on its atmospheric composition, this planet may have migrated significantly during its formation. We show that including the chemical evolution of the protoplanetary disk leads to a reduced need for migration. Moreover, we find that pebble accretion can reproduce the planet's composition, but some of our tested setups lead to too low atmospheric metallicities, even when considering that evaporating pebbles may enrich the disk gas. We conclude that the definitive inversion from atmospheric abundances to planet formation for a given planet may be challenging, but a qualitative understanding of the effects of different formation models is possible, opening up pathways for new investigations.},

We therefore study the properties of irradiated exoplanet atmospheres over a wide parameter range including metallicity, C/O ratio, and host spectral type. We calculate a grid of 1D radiative-convective atmospheres and emission spectra. We perform the calculations with our new Pressure-Temperature Iterator and Spectral Emission Calculator for Planetary Atmospheres (PETIT) code, assuming chemical equilibrium. The atmospheric structures and spectra are made available online. We find that atmospheres of planets with C/O ratios {$\sim$}1 and \{T\}\{\{eff\}\} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1500 K can exhibit inversions due to heating by the alkalis because the main coolants CH4, H2O, and HCN are depleted. Therefore, temperature inversions possibly occur without the presence of additional absorbers like TiO and VO. At low temperatures we find that the pressure level of the photosphere strongly influences whether the atmospheric opacity is dominated by either water (for low C/O) or methane (for high C/O), or both (regardless of the C/O). For hot, carbon-rich objects this pressure level governs whether the atmosphere is dominated by methane or HCN. Further we find that host stars of late spectral type lead to planetary atmospheres which have shallower, more isothermal temperature profiles. In agreement with prior work we find that for planets with \{T\}\{\{eff\}\} 1750 K the transition between water or methane dominated spectra occurs at C/O {$\sim$} 0.7, instead of {$\sim$}1, because condensation preferentially removes oxygen.},

The somewhat slower, correlated-k method is used at low resolution because it is more accurate than methods such as opacity sampling. Clouds can be included and treated using wavelength-dependent power law opacities, or by using optical constants of real condensates, specifying either the cloud particle size, or the atmospheric mixing and particle settling strength. Opacities of amorphous or crystalline, spherical or irregularly-shaped cloud particles are available. The line opacity database spans temperatures between 80 and 3000 K, allowing to model fluxes of objects such as terrestrial planets, super-Earths, Neptunes, or hot Jupiters , if their atmospheres are hydrogen-dominated. Higher temperature points and species will be added in the future, allowing to also model the class of ultra hot-Jupiters, with equilibrium temperatures Teq 2000 K.

The code is fast, accurate, and versatile; it can calculate both transmission and emission spectra within a few seconds at low resolution (\emph{{$\lambda<$}i/{$>$}/{$\Delta$}\emph{{$\lambda<$}i/{$>$} = 1000; correlated-k method) and high resolution (\emph{{$\lambda<$}i/{$>$}/{$\Delta$}\emph{{$\lambda<$}i/{$>$} = 10\textsuperscript{6{$<$}sup/{$>$}; line-by-line method), using only a few lines of input instruction. The somewhat slower, correlated-k method is used at low resolution because it is more accurate than methods such as opacity sampling. Clouds can be included and treated using wavelength-dependent power law opacities, or by using optical constants of real condensates, specifying either the cloud particle size, or the atmospheric mixing and particle settling strength. Opacities of amorphous or crystalline, spherical or irregularly-shaped cloud particles are available. The line opacity database spans temperatures between 80 and 3000 K, allowing to model fluxes of objects such as terrestrial planets, super-Earths, Neptunes, or hot Jupiters, if their atmospheres are hydrogen-dominated. Higher temperature points and species will be added in the future, allowing to also model the class of ultra hot-Jupiters, with equilibrium temperatures \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eq{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2000 K.

We added the effect of multiple scattering which is important for treating clouds. Two cloud model parameterizations are tested: the first incorporates the mixing and settling of condensates, the second simply parameterizes the functional form of the opacity. Results. In mock retrievals, using an inadequate cloud model may result in atmospheres that are more isothermal and less cloudy than the input. Applying our framework on observations of HR 8799e made with the GPI, SPHERE, and GRAVITY, we find a cloudy atmosphere governed by not yet produced a well disequilibrium chemistry, confirming previous analyses. We retrieve constrained C/O value for this planet. The retrieved C/O values of that C/O = both cloud m0.o6d0e+-l00s..0078a.reOcthoenrsmistoednet,lswhhaivlee leading to different atmospheric structures: either cloudy or more isothermal and less cloudy. Fitting the observations with the selfconsistent Exo-REM model leads to comparable results, without constraining C/O. Conclusions. With data from the most sensitive instruments, retrieval analyses of directly imaged planets are possible. The inferred C/O ratio of HR 8799e is independent of the cloud model and thus appears to be a robust. This C/O is consistent with stellar, which could indicate that the HR 8799e formed outside the CO2 or CO iceline. As it is the innermost planet of the system, this constraint could apply to all HR 8799 planets.},

  abstract = {In order to improve the physical interpretation about innermost dusty regions in protoplanetary discs around brown dwarf (BD), and even very low mass star (VLMS), we present a grid of models taking into account two different sets: (i) The set called standard model, that simulates an axisymmetric dusty disc with an inner curved wall. (ii) The perturbed one called non-standard where the axisymmetry of the inner edge has been broken. We have achieved a fitting for the disc structure able to explain the spectral energy distribution (SED). As the main condition, we assume that the changes of the inner wall geometry in the tongue-like shape depend on the Rayleigh--Taylor instability (R-TIns) generated in the inner disc edge. For each object, we parametrize the shape of the inner wall to find a time-dependent model that enables us to explain the photometric near-Infrared variability and connect the changes on the inner disc structure with the amplitude of such variability. We re-analysed photometric measurements from near to mid-infrared wavelengths of a sample of 6 BDs and one VLMS in different cloud associations which were previously studied by other authors. We also show that the flux change calculated between the non-standard and the standard configurations models the observed variability in LRLL 1679. The magnitude changes due to these fluctuations slightly depend on the wavelength and they can present differences of up to 0.9 mag. We suggest that if the R-TIns persist enough time, the features in the protoplanetary inner disc, e.g. inner holes or gaps evolve.},

We present a ``chain'' of models, linking the formation of a planet to its observable present-day spectrum. The chain links include (1) the planet's formation and migration, (2) its long-term thermodynamic evolution, (3) a variety of disk chemistry models, (4) a non-gray atmospheric model, and (5) a radiometric model to obtain simulated spectroscopic observations with James Webb Space Telescope and ARIEL. In our standard chemistry model the inner disk is depleted in refractory carbon as in the Solar System and in white dwarfs polluted by extrasolar planetesimals. Our main findings are: (1) envelope enrichment by planetesimal impacts during formation dominates the final planetary atmospheric composition of hot Jupiters. We investigate two, under this finding, prototypical formation pathways: a formation inside or outside the water iceline, called ``dry'' and ``wet'' planets, respectively. (2) Both the ``dry'' and ``wet'' planets are oxygen-rich (C/O {$<$} 1) due to the oxygen-rich nature of the solid building blocks. The ``dry'' planet's C/O ratio is {$<$}0.2 for standard carbon depletion, while the ``wet'' planet has typical C/O values between 0.1 and 0.5 depending mainly on the clathrate formation efficiency. Only non-standard disk chemistries without carbon depletion lead to carbon-rich C/O ratios {$>$}1 for the ``dry'' planet. (3) While we consistently find C/O ratios {$<$}1, they still vary significantly. To link a formation history to a specific C/O, a better understanding of the disk chemistry is thus needed.},

Comparison with unsigned magnetic fluxes demonstrates that the second category of magnetic fields shows less organization (less energy in the large scales), similarly to partly convective early M dwarfs. Stars in both categories have similar stellar parameters, our data do not evidence a separation between these two categories in the mass--rotation plane.We also report marginal detection of a large-scale magnetic field on the M8 star VB 10 featuring a significant toroidal axisymmetric component, whereas no field is detectable on VB 8 (M7).},

  abstract = {The relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen is a potent tracer of planet formation and evolution. Jupiter and Saturn have protosolar atmospheric D/H ratios, a relic of substantial gas accretion from the nebula, while the atmospheres of Neptune and Uranus are enhanced in D by accretion of ices into their envelopes. For terrestrial planets, D/H ratios are used to determine the mechanisms of volatile delivery and subsequent atmosphere loss over the lifetime of the planet. Planets and brown dwarfs more massive than {$\sim$}13 M J quickly fuse their initial D reservoir. Here, we simulate spectra for giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs (2 M Neptune to {$\sim$}10 M Jupiter) from T eff = 200-1800 K including both CH3D and HDO to determine the observability of these dominant deuterium isotopologues in mid-infrared thermal emission spectra. Colder objects have stronger molecular features in their spectra, due to the temperature dependence of molecular cross sections. CH3D is easier to observe than HDO at all temperatures considered, due to the strength of its absorption bands and locations of features at wavelengths with few other strong absorption features. We predict that for nearby cool brown dwarfs, the CH3D abundance can be measured at high signal to noise with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST); for objects from 200 to 800 K closer than 10 pc, a protosolar D/H ratio would be readily observable in 2.5 hr. Moderately young Jupiter-mass planets (100-300 Myr) and young Neptunes (10 Myr) may be discovered with JWST and provide the best targets for detecting deuterium on an exoplanet in the coming decade. Future telescope designs should consider the importance of isotopes for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary atmospheres.},

  abstract = {As brown dwarfs cool, a variety of species condense in their atmospheres, forming clouds. Iron and silicate clouds shape the emergent spectra of L dwarfs, but these clouds dissipate at the L/T transition. A variety of other condensates are expected to form in cooler T dwarf atmospheres. These include Cr, MnS, Na2S, ZnS, and KCl, but the opacity of these optically thinner clouds has not been included in previous atmosphere models. Here, we examine their effect on model T and Y dwarf atmospheres. The cloud structures and opacities are calculated using the Ackerman \& Marley cloud model, which is coupled to an atmosphere model to produce atmospheric pressure--temperature profiles in radiative--convective equilibrium. We generate a suite of models between Teff = 400 and 1300 K, log g = 4.0 and 5.5, and condensate sedimentation efficiencies from fsed = 2 to 5. Model spectra are compared to two red T dwarfs, Ross 458C and UGPS 0722--05; models that include clouds are found to match observed spectra significantly better than cloudless models. The emergence of sulfide clouds in cool atmospheres, particularly Na2S, may be a more natural explanation for the ``cloudy'' spectra of these objects, rather than the reemergence of silicate clouds that wane at the L-to-T transition. We find that sulfide clouds provide a mechanism to match the near- and mid-infrared colors of observed T dwarfs. Our results indicate that including the opacity of condensates in T dwarf atmospheres is necessary to accurately determine the physical characteristics of many of the observed objects.},

The spectral energy distribution for 2MASSW J1139511--315921 is consistent with a stellar photosphere for the entire wavelength range of our data, whereas the other two objects exhibit significant excess emission at {$\lambda$} {$>$} 5{$\mu$}m. We are able to reproduce the excess emission from each brown dwarf using our models of irradiated accretion disks. According to our model fits, both disks have experienced a high degree of dust settling. We also find that silicate emission at 10 and 20 {$\mu$}m is absent from the spectra of these disks, indicating that grains in the upper disk layers have grown to sizes larger than 5 {$\mu$}m. Both of these characteristics are consistent with previous observations of decreasing silicate emission with lower stellar masses and older ages. These trends suggest that either (1) the growth of dust grains, and perhaps planetesimal formation, occurs faster in disks around brown dwarfs than in disks around stars or (2) the radii of the mid-IR-emitting regions of disks are smaller for brown dwarfs than for stars, and grains grow faster at smaller disk radii. Finally, we note the possible detection of an unexplained emission feature near 14 {$\mu$}m in the spectra of both of the disk-bearing brown dwarfs.},

Here we investigate the coupled chemistry of neutral carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen species on HD 189733b and HD 209458b and we compare the model results with existing transit and eclipse observations. We find that the vertical profiles of molecular constituents are significantly affected by transport-induced quenching and photochemistry, particularly on the cooler HD 189733b however, the warmer stratospheric temperatures on HD 209458b help maintain thermochemical equilibrium and reduce the effects of disequilibrium chemistry. For both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are found to be enhanced over their equilibrium values at pressures of a few bar to less than an mbar due to transport-induced quenching, but CH4 and NH3 are photochemically removed at higher altitudes. Disequilibrium chemistry also enhances atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons (particularly C2H2), some nitriles (particularly HCN), and radicals like OH, CH3, and NH2. In contrast, CO, H2O, N2, and CO2 more closely follow their equilibrium profiles, except at pressures lsim1 {$\mu$}bar, where CO, H2O, and N2 are photochemically destroyed and CO2 is produced before its eventual high-altitude destruction. The enhanced abundances of CH4, NH3, and HCN are expected to affect the spectral signatures and thermal profiles of HD 189733b and other relatively cool, transiting exoplanets.

  abstract = {This review examines the state-of-the-art knowledge of high-mass star and massive cluster formation, gained from ambitious observational surveys, which acknowledges the multiscale characteristics of these processes. After a brief overview of theoretical models and main open issues, we present observational searches for the evolutionary phases of high-mass star formation, first among high-luminosity sources and more recently among young massive protostars and the elusive high-mass prestellar cores. We then introduce the most likely evolutionary scenario for high-mass star formation, which emphasizes the link of high-mass star formation to massive cloud and cluster formation. Finally, we introduce the first attempts to search for variations of the star-formation activity and cluster formation in molecular cloud complexes in the most extreme star-forming sites and across the Milky Way. The combination of Galactic plane surveys and high--angular resolution images with submillimeter facilities such as Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) are prerequisites to make significant progress in the forthcoming decade.},

The SPIRou Legacy Survey collected data from February 2019 to June 2022, half of the time devoted to a blind search for exoplanets around nearby cool stars. The aim of this paper is to present this program and an overview of its properties, and to revisit the radial velocity (RV) data of two multiplanet systems, including new visits with SPIRou. From SPIRou data, we can extract precise RVs using efficient telluric correction and line-by-line measurement techniques, and we can reconstruct stellar magnetic fields from the collection of polarized spectra using the Zeeman-Doppler imaging method. The stellar sample of our blind search in the solar neighborhood, the observing strategy, the RV noise estimates, chromatic behavior, and current limitations of SPIRou RV measurements on bright M dwarfs are described. In addition, SPIRou data over a 2.5-yr time span allow us to revisit the known multiplanet systems GJ 876 and GJ 1148. For GJ 876, the new dynamical analysis including the four planets is consistent with previous models and confirms that this system is deep in the Laplace resonance and likely chaotic. The large-scale magnetic map of GJ 876 over two consecutive observing seasons is obtained and shows a dominant dipolar field with a polar strength of 30 G, which defines the magnetic environment in which the inner planet with a period of 1.94 days is embedded. For GJ 1148, we refine the known two-planet model. {$<$}P /{$>$}RV time series are available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {$<$}A href="https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/"{$>$}cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr{$<$}/A{$>$} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/678/A207"{$>$}https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/678/A207{$<$}/A{$>$}},

Reflected light spectroscopy is encoded with rich information about the scattering and absorbing properties of planet atmospheres. Given the diversity of clouds and hazes expected in exoplanets, it is imperative that we solidify the methodology to accurately and precisely retrieve these scattering and absorbing properties that are agnostic to cloud species. In particular, we focus on determining how different cloud parameterizations affect resultant inferences of both cloud and atmospheric composition. We simulate mock observations of the reflected spectra from three top-priority direct imaging cool giant targets with different effective temperatures, ranging from 135 to 533 K. We perform retrievals of cloud structure and molecular abundances on these three planets using four different parameterizations, each with an increasing level of cloud complexity. We find that the retrieved atmospheric and scattering properties depend strongly on the choice of cloud parameterization. For example, parameterizations that are too simplistic tend to overestimate the abundances. Overall, we are unable to retrieve precise/accurate gravity beyond {\textpm}50\%. Lastly, we find that even reflected light spectroscopy with a low signal-to-noise ratio of 5 and low R = 40 gives cursory zeroth-order insights into the position of the cloud deck relative to the molecular and Rayleigh optical depth level.},

  abstract = {Disequilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing in the atmospheres of many brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets is well established. Atmosphere models for these objects typically parameterize mixing with the highly uncertain K zz diffusion parameter. The role of mixing in altering the abundances of C-N-O-bearing molecules has mostly been explored for atmospheres with a solar composition. However, atmospheric metallicity and the C/O ratio also impact atmospheric chemistry. Therefore, we present the Sonora Elf Owl grid of self-consistent cloud-free 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model atmospheres for JWST observations, which includes a variation in K zz across several orders of magnitude and also encompasses subsolar to supersolar metallicities and C/O ratios. We find that the impact of K zz on the T(P) profile and spectra is a strong function of both T eff and metallicity. For metal-poor objects, K zz has large impacts on the atmosphere at significantly higher T eff than in metal-rich atmospheres, where the impact of K zz is seen to occur at lower T eff. We identify significant spectral degeneracies between varying K zz and metallicity in multiple wavelength windows, in particular, at 3--5 {$\mu$}m. We use the Sonora Elf Owl atmospheric grid to fit the observed spectra of a sample of nine early to late T-type objects from T eff = 550--1150 K. We find evidence for very inefficient vertical mixing in these objects, with inferred K zz values lying in the range between {$\sim$}101 and 104 cm2 s-1. Using self-consistent models, we find that this slow vertical mixing is due to the observations, which probe mixing in the deep detached radiative zone in these atmospheres.},

The observations reveal hundreds of water vapor lines from 4.9--25.5 {$\mu$}m toward the inner {$\sim$}1 au in the disk, including the first detection of rovibrational water emission in this disk. The spectrum is dominated by hot ({$\sim$}800 K) water vapor and OH gas, with only marginal detections of CO2, HCN, and a possible colder water vapor component. Using slab models with a detailed treatment of opacities and line overlap, we retrieve the column density, emitting area, and excitation temperature of water vapor and OH, and provide upper limits for the observable mass of other molecules. Compared to MIRI spectra of other T Tauri disks, the inner disk of AS 209 does not appear to be atypically depleted in CO2 nor HCN. Based on Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph observations, we further find evidence for molecular emission variability over a 10 yr baseline. Water, OH, and CO2 line luminosities have decreased by factors of 2--4 in the new MIRI epoch, yet there are minimal continuum emission variations.

  abstract = {The mid-infrared water vapor emission spectrum provides a novel way to characterize the delivery of icy pebbles towards the innermost ({$<$} 5 au) regions of planet-forming disks. Recently, JWST MIRI-MRS showed that compact disks exhibit an excess of low-energy water vapor emission relative to extended multi-gapped disks, suggesting that icy pebble drift is more efficient in the former. We carry out detailed emission line modeling to retrieve the excitation conditions of rotational water vapor emission in a sample of four compact and three extended disks within the JDISC Survey. We present two-temperature H2O slab model retrievals and, for the first time, constrain the spatial distribution of water vapor by fitting parametric radial temperature and column density profiles. Such models statistically outperform the two-temperature slab fits. We find a correlation between the observable hot water vapor mass and stellar mass accretion rate, as well as an anti-correlation between cold water vapor mass and sub-mm dust disk radius, confirming previously reported water line flux trends. We find that the mid-IR spectrum traces H2O with temperatures down to 180-300 K, but the coldest 150-170 K gas remains undetected. Furthermore the H2O temperature profiles are generally steeper and cooler than the expected `super-heated' dust temperature in passive irradiated disks. The column density profiles are used to estimate icy pebble mass fluxes, which suggest that compact and extended disks may produce markedly distinct inner-disk exoplanet populations if local feeding mechanisms dominate their assembly.},

  abstract = {Several stars show deep transits consistent with discs of roughly \$1{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}, R\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ seen at moderate inclinations, likely surrounding planets on eccentric orbits. We show that this configuration arises naturally as a result of planet--planet scattering when the planets possess satellite systems. Planet--planet scattering explains the orbital eccentricities of the discs' host bodies, while the close encounters during scattering lead to the exchange of satellites between planets and/or their destabilization. This leads to collisions between satellites and their tidal disruption close to the planet. Both of these events lead to large quantities of debris being produced, which in time will settle into a disc such as those observed. The mass of debris required is comparable to a Ceres-sized satellite. Through N-body simulations of planets with clones of the Galilean satellite system undergoing scattering, we show that 90 per\,cent of planets undergoing scattering will possess debris from satellite destruction. Extrapolating to smaller numbers of satellites suggests that tens of~per\,cent of such planets should still possess circumplanetary debris discs. The debris trails arising from these events are often tilted at tens of degrees to the planetary orbit, consistent with the inclinations of the observed discs. Disruption of satellite systems during scattering thus simultaneously explains the existence of debris, the tilt of the discs, and the eccentricity of the planets they orbit.},

Hydrogen and Na I line profiles were calculated, including line damping and continuum opacity for a grid of models spanning a large range of infall rates, magnetospheric geometries, and gas temperatures. We also calculated models for rotating magnetospheres and show that for typical T Tauri rotation rates, the line profiles are not significantly affected. We show that line-damping wings can produce significant high-velocity emission at H{$\alpha$}, and to a lesser extent in higher Balmer lines, in much better agreement with observations than previous models. We present comparisons to specific objects spanning a wide range of accretion activity and find that in most cases the models successfully reproduce the observed emission profile features. Blueshifted absorption components cannot be explained without including a wind outside of the magnetosphere, and true P Cygni Balmer line profiles in the few objects with extreme accretion activity indicate both absorption and emission from a wind. We constrain the range of gas temperatures required to explain observational diagnostics like profile shapes, line ratios, and continuum emission. The exact heating mechanism remains unclear but is probably linked to the accretion process itself. In order to explain observed correlations between line emission and accretion luminosity, we find that the size of the emitting region must be correlated with the accretion rate. We suggest that such a correlation may manifest itself in reality via nonaxisymmetric accretion, where the number and/or width of discrete funnel flows increase with increasing accretion rate, a scenario also indicated by accretion shock models.},

We have identified 11 new substellar accretors, more than tripling the number of known brown dwarfs with measurable accretion activity. These include the lowest-mass objects yet seen with accretion, with masses down to {\textasciitilde}0.015 Msolar. Using models of H{$\alpha$} emission produced in magnetospheric accretion flows, the most widely applicable primary calibrator now available, we determine the first estimates of mass accretion rates for objects at such extremely low masses. For the six objects with masses {$<$}{\textasciitilde}0.03 Msolar, we find accretion rates of {\textasciitilde}5{\texttimes}10-12 Msolar yr-1, among the smallest yet measured. These new results continue the trend of decreasing mass accretion rate with decreasing (sub)stellar mass that we have noted previously for samples of more massive objects; the overall correlation is M˙{\textasciitilde}M2.1, and it now extends over a mass range of over 2 orders of magnitude. Finally, the absence of a discontinuity in the distribution of accretion rates with mass tends to suggest that stars and brown dwarfs share similar formation histories.

  abstract = {Orbital eccentricities directly trace the formation mechanisms and dynamical histories of substellar companions. Here, we study the effect of hyperpriors on the population-level eccentricity distributions inferred for the sample of directly imaged substellar companions (brown dwarfs and cold Jupiters) from hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM). We find that the choice of hyperprior can have a significant impact on the population-level eccentricity distribution inferred for imaged companions, an effect that becomes more important as the sample size and orbital coverage decrease to values that mirror the existing sample. We reanalyze the current observational sample of imaged giant planets in the 5-100 au range from Bowler et al. and find that the underlying eccentricity distribution implied by the imaged planet sample is broadly consistent with the eccentricity distribution for close-in exoplanets detected using radial velocities. Furthermore, our analysis supports the conclusion from that study that long-period giant planets and brown dwarf eccentricity distributions differ by showing that it is robust to the choice of hyperprior. We release our HBM and forward-modeling code in an open-source Python package, ePop!, and make it freely available to the community.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that high C/O ratios ({$>$}0.8) in circumstellar disks lead to the formation of carbon-dominated planets. Based on the expectation that elemental abundances in the stellar photospheres give the initial abundances in the circumstellar disks, the frequency distributions of C/O ratios of solar-type stars have been obtained by several groups. The results of these investigations are mixed. Some find C/O {$>$} 0.8 in more than 20\% of stars, and C/O {$>$} 1.0 in more than 6\%. Others find C/O {$>$} 0.8 in none of the sample stars. These works on solar-type stars are all differential abundance analyses with respect to the Sun and depend on the adopted C/O ratio in the Sun. Recently, a method of molecular line spectroscopy of M dwarfs, in which carbon and oxygen abundances are derived respectively from CO and H2O lines in the K band, has been developed. The resolution of the K-band spectrum is 20,000. Carbon and oxygen abundances of 46 M dwarfs have been obtained by this nondifferential abundance analysis. Carbon-to-oxygen ratios in M dwarfs derived by this method are more robust than those in solar-type stars derived from neutral carbon and oxygen lines in the visible spectra because of the difficulty in the treatment of oxygen lines. We have compared the frequency distribution of C/O distributions in M dwarfs with those of solar-type stars and have found that the low frequency of high-C/O ratios is preferred.},

  abstract = {Context. The origin and evolution of fluorine in the Milky Way Galaxy is still under debate. In particular, the increase in the [F/Fe] in metal-rich stars found from near-IR HF lines is challenging to explain theoretically. Chemical evolution models with current knowledge of yields from different fluorine-producing stellar sources cannot reproduce these observations. Aims: The aim of this work is to observationally study the Galactic chemical evolution of fluorine, especially for metal-rich stars. We want to investigate whether the significant rise in fluorine production at high metallicities can be corroborated. Furthermore, we want to explore the possible reasons for this upturn in [F/Fe]. Methods: We determined the fluorine abundances from 50 M giants (3300 {$<$} Teff {$<$} 3800 K) in the solar neighborhood spanning a broad range of metallicities (-0.9 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} 0.25 dex). These stars are cool enough to have an array of lines from the HF molecule in the K band. We observed the stars with the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) spectrometer mounted on the Gemini South telescope and on the Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory and investigate each of 10 HF molecular lines in detail. Results: Based on a detailed line-by-line analysis of ten HF lines, we find that the R19, R18, and R16 lines (22 699.49, 22 714.59, and 22 778.25 {\AA}) should primarily be used for an abundance analysis. The R15, R14, and R13 lines at 22 826.86, 22 886.73, and 22 957.94 {\AA} can also be used, but the trends based on these lines show increasing dependence on the stellar parameters. The strongest HF lines, namely R12, R11, R9, and R7 lying at 23 040.57, 23 134.76, 23 358.33, and 23 629.99 {\AA} should be avoided. The abundances derived from these strongest lines show significant trends with the stellar parameters, as well as a high sensitivity to variations in the stellar microturbulence, especially for coolest and most metal-rich stars. This leads to a huge scatter and high fluorine abundances for supersolar metallicity stars, not seen in the trends from the weaker lines for the same stars. Conclusions: When estimating the final mean fluorine abundance trend as a function of metallicity, we neglect the fluorine abundances from the four strongest lines (R7, R9, R11, and R12) for all stars and use only those derived from R16, R18, and R19 for the coolest and most metal-rich stars. We confirm the flat trend of [F/Fe] found in other studies for stars in the metallicity range of -1.0 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} 0.0 dex. We also find a slight enhancement at super-solar metallicities (0 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} 0.15 dex) but we cannot confirm the upward trend seen at [Fe/H] {$>$} 0.25 dex. The HF line is intrinsically temperature sensitive, which calls for studies of stars with highly accurate and homogeneous stellar parameters. The spread in our trend is presumably caused by the temperature sensitivity. We need more observations of M giants at super-solar metallicities with a spectrometer that covers as many of the HF lines as possible, for instance the IGRINS spectrometer, to confirm whether the metal-rich fluorine abundance upturn is real or not.},

  abstract = {With four companions at separations from 16 to 71 au, HR 8799 is a unique target for direct imaging, presenting an opportunity for the comparative study of exoplanets with a shared formation history. Combining new VLTI/GRAVITY observations obtained within the ExoGRAVITY program with archival data, we perform a systematic atmospheric characterisation of all four planets. We explore different levels of model flexibility to understand the temperature structure, chemistry and clouds of each planet using both petitRADTRANS atmospheric retrievals and fits to self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium models. Using Bayesian Model Averaging to combine multiple retrievals, we find that the HR 8799 planets are highly enriched in metals, with [M/H] \${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$1, and have stellar to super-stellar C/O ratios. The C/O ratio increases with increasing separation from \$0.55{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\_\{-0.10\}\$ for d to \$0.78{\textasciicircum}\{+0.03\}\_\{-0.04\}\$ for b, with the exception of the innermost planet which has a C/O ratio of \$0.87{\textbackslash}pm0.03\$. By retrieving a quench pressure and using a disequilibrium chemistry model we derive vertical mixing strengths compatible with predictions for high-metallicity, self-luminous atmospheres. Bayesian evidence comparisons strongly favour the presence of HCN in HR 8799 c and e, as well as CH\$\_\{4\}\$ in HR 8799 c, with detections at \${$>$}5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence. All of the planets are cloudy, with no evidence for patchiness. The clouds of c, d and e are best fit by silicate clouds lying above a deep iron cloud layer, while the clouds of the cooler HR 8799 b are more likely composed of Na\$\_\{2\}\$S. With well defined atmospheric properties, future exploration of this system is well positioned to unveil further detail in these planets, extending our understanding of the composition, structure, and formation history of these siblings.},

For 8 objects we obtained high resolution H{$\alpha$} profiles and determined mass accretion rate {\textbackslash}dot Mac and accretion luminosity Lac. Pa{\textbackslash}beta is detected in emission in 7 of the 10 {$\rho$} Oph objects, but only in one in Cha I. Using objects for which we have both a determination of Lac from H{$\alpha$} and a Pa{$\beta$} detection,\vphantom\{\} we show that the correlation between the Pa{$\beta$} luminosity and luminosity Lac, found by Muzerolle et al. ({\textbackslash}cite\{Mea98\}) for T Tauri stars in Taurus, extends to objects with mass {$\sim$}0.03 M{$\odot$}; L(Pa{$\beta$}) can be used to measure Lac also in the substellar regime. The results were less conclusive for Br{$\gamma$}, which was detected only in 2 objects, neither of which had an H{$\alpha$} estimate of {\textbackslash}dot Mac. Using the relation between L(Pa{\textbackslash}beta) and Lac we determined the accretion rate for all the objects in our sample (including those with no H{$\alpha$} spectrum), \vphantom\{\} more than doubling the number of substellar objects with known {\textbackslash}dot Mac. When plotted as a function of the mass of the central object together with data from the literature, our results confirm the trend of lower {\textbackslash}dot Mac for lower M*, although with a large spread. Some of the spread is probably due to an age effect; our very young objects in {$\rho$} Oph have on average an accretion rate at least one order of magnitude higher than objects of similar mass in older regions. As a side product, we found that the width of H{$\alpha$} measured at 10\% peak intensity is not only a qualitative indicator of the accreting nature of very low mass objects, but can be used to obtain a quantitative, although not very accurate, estimate of {\textbackslash}dot Mac over a large mass range, from T Tauri stars to brown dwarfs. Finally, we found that some of our objects show evidence of mass-loss in their optical spectra. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile.

  abstract = {Future space-based telescopes, such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), will observe the reflected light spectra of directly imaged extrasolar planets. Interpretation of such data presents a number of novel challenges, including accounting for unknown planet radius and uncertain stellar illumination phase angle. Here, we report on our continued development of Markov Chain Monte Carlo retrieval methods for addressing these issues in the interpretation of such data. Specifically, we explore how the unknown planet radius and potentially poorly known observer-planet-star phase angle impacts retrievals of parameters of interest such as atmospheric methane abundance, cloud properties, and surface gravity. As expected, the uncertainty in retrieved values is a strong function of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the observed spectra, particularly for low metallicity atmospheres, which lack deep absorption signatures. Meaningful results may only be possible above certain S/N thresholds; for cases across a metallicity range of 1--50 times solar, we find that only an S/N of 20 systematically reproduces a value close to the correct methane abundance at all phase angles. However, even in cases where the phase angle is poorly known we find that the planet radius can be constrained to within a factor of two. We find that uncertainty in planet radius decreases at phase angles past quadrature, as the highly forward-scattering nature of the atmosphere at these geometries limits the possible volume of phase space that relevant parameters can occupy. Finally, we present an estimation of possible improvement that can result from combining retrievals against observations at multiple phase angles.},

  abstract = {Neuhaeuser et al. (2005) presented direct imaging evidence for a sub-stellar companion to the young T Tauri star GQ Lup. Common proper motion was highly significant, but no orbital motion was detected. Faint luminosity, low gravity, and a late-M/early-L spectral type indicated that the companion is either a planet or a brown dwarf. We have monitored GQ Lup and its companion in order to detect orbital and parallactic motion and variability in its brightness. We also search for closer and fainter companions. We have taken six more images with the VLT Adaptive Optics instrument NACO from May 2005 to Feb 2007, always with the same calibration binary from Hipparcos for both astrometric and photometric calibration. By adding up all the images taken so far, we search for additional companions. The position of GQ Lup A and its companion compared to a nearby non-moving background object varies as expected for parallactic motion by about one pixel (2 {\textbackslash}pi with parallax {\textbackslash}pi). We could not find evidence for variability of the GQ Lup companion in the K-band (standard deviation being {\textbackslash}pm 0.08 mag), which may be due to large error bars. No additional companions are found with deep imaging. There is now exceedingly high significance for common proper motion of GQ Lup A and its companion. In addition, we see for the first time an indication for orbital motion (about 2 to 3 mas/yr decrease in separation, but no significant change in the position angle), consistent with a near edge-on or highly eccentric orbit. We measured the parallax for GQ Lup A to be {\textbackslash}pi = 6.4 {\textbackslash}pm 1.9 mas (i.e. 156 {\textbackslash}pm 50 pc) and for the GQ Lup companion to be 7.2 {\textbackslash}pm 2.1 mas (i.e. 139 {\textbackslash}pm 45 pc), both consistent with being in the Lupus I cloud and bound to each other.},

With detections of six planets and four brown dwarfs, including the new discoveries of 51 Eridani b and HR 2562 B, GPIES also has a significantly higher planet detection rate than any published imaging survey. Our analysis of the uniform sample of the first 300 stars reveals new properties of giant planets ({$>$}2 MJup) from 3-100 AU. We find at {$>$}3 {$\sigma$} confidence that these planets are more common around high-mass stars ({$>$} 1.5 solar masses) than lower-mass stars. We also present evidence that giant planets and brown dwarfs obey different mass functions and semi-major axis distributions. Our direct imaging data imply that the giant planet occurrence rate declines with semi-major axis beyond 10 AU, a trend opposite to that found by radial velocity surveys inside of 10 AU; taken together, the giant planet occurrence rate appears to peak at 3-10 AU. All of these trends point to wide-separation giant planets forming by core/pebble accretion, and brown dwarfs forming by gravitational instability. If our power-law model that fits giant planets around high-mass stars is also applicable to solar-type stars, and these power-laws remain valid down to the mass of Jupiter and inward to 5 AU, then the occurrence rate for giant planets more massive than Jupiter within 100 AU could be less than 40\%. Looking beyond these results, we present our early analysis of the full GPIES sample, whether these trends persist over all 521 observed stars, and implications for future observations from Gemini-North with an upgraded GPI.},

Still, our knowledge of the abundances of these elements in different stellar populations is uncertain because of difficulties in observing and analyzing atomic and molecular lines of C and O.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}Abundances of C, O, and Fe are determined for F and G main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood with metallicities in the range -1.6 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} +0.4 in order to study trends and possible systematic differences in the C/Fe, O/Fe, and C/O ratios for thin- and thick-disk stars as well as high- and low-alpha halo stars. In addition, we investigate if there is any connection between C and O abundances in stellar atmospheres and the occurrence of planets.\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}Carbon abundances are determined from the \emph{{$\lambda\lambda<$}i/{$>$} 5052,5380 C i lines and oxygen abundances from the \emph{{$\lambda<$}i/{$>$}7774 O i triplet and the forbidden [O i] line at 6300 {\AA}.

This has led to discussions about the existence of terrestrial planets with a carbon-dominated composition that is very different from the composition of the Earth.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}The mentioned C/O values were obtained by determining carbon abundances from high-excitation C i lines and oxygen abundances from the forbidden [O i] line at 6300 {\AA}.

Assuming that the composition of a proto-planetary disk is the same as that of the host star, the C/O values found in this paper lend no support to the existence of carbon-rich planets.

Methods to determine such high-precision abundances together with precise values of effective temperatures and surface gravities from equivalent widths of spectral lines or by spectrum synthesis techniques are outlined, and effects on abundance determinations from using a 3D non-LTE analysis instead of a classical 1D LTE analysis are considered. The determination of high-precision stellar abundances of the elements has led to the discovery of unexpected phenomena and relations with important bearings on the astrophysics of galaxies, stars, and planets, i.e. (i) Existence of discrete stellar populations within each of the main Galactic components (disk, halo, and bulge) providing new constraints on models for the formation of the Milky Way. (ii) Differences in the relation between abundances and elemental condensation temperature for the Sun and solar twins suggesting dust-cleansing effects in proto-planetary disks and/or engulfment of planets by stars; (iii) Differences in chemical composition between binary star components and between members of open or globular clusters showing that star- and cluster-formation processes are more complicated than previously thought; (iv) Tight relations between some abundance ratios and age for solar-like stars providing new constraints on nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution models as well as the composition of terrestrial exoplanets. We conclude that if stellar abundances with precisions of 0.01--0.03~dex can be achieved in studies of more distant stars and stars on the giant and supergiant branches, many more interesting future applications, of great relevance to stellar and galaxy evolution, are probable. Hence, in planning abundance surveys, it is important to carefully balance the need for large samples of stars against the spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio needed to obtain high-precision abundances. Furthermore, it is an advantage to work differentially on stars with similar atmospheric parameters, because then a simple 1D LTE analysis of stellar spectra may be sufficient. However, when determining high-precision absolute abundances or differential abundance between stars having more widely different parameters, e.g. metal-poor stars compared to the Sun or giants to dwarfs, then 3D non-LTE effects must be taken into account.},

  abstract = {Abstract-- We review current observational and theoretical constraints on the galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of oxygen isotopes to explore whether GCE plays a role in explaining the lower 17O/18O ratio of the Sun, relative to the present-day interstellar medium, or the existence of distinct 16O-rich and 16O-poor reservoirs in the solar system. Although the production of both 17O and 18O are related to the metallicity of progenitor stars, 17O is most likely produced in stars that evolve on longer timescales than those that produce 18O. Therefore, the 17O/18O ratio need not have remained constant over time, contrary to preconceptions and the simplest models of GCE. An apparent linear, slope-one correlation between {$\delta$}17O and {$\delta$}18O in the ISM need not necessarily reflect an O isotopic gradient, and any slope-one galactocentric gradient need not correspond to evolution in time. Instead, increasing 17O/18O is consistent both with observational data from molecular clouds and with modeling of the compositions of presolar grains. Models in which the rate of star formation has decelerated over the past few Gyr or in which an enhanced period of star formation occurred shortly before solar birth (``starburst'') can explain the solar-ISM O-isotopic difference without requiring a local input of supernova ejecta into the protosolar cloud. ``Cosmic chemical memory'' models in which interstellar dust is on average older than interstellar gas predict that primordial solar system solids should be 16O-rich, relative to the Sun, in conflict with observations. However, scenarios can be constructed in which the 16O-rich contribution of very massive stars could lead to 16O-poor solids and a 16O-rich bulk Sun, if the solar system formed shortly after a starburst, independent of the popular scenario of photochemical self-shielding of CO.},

  abstract = {OH rotational temperatures are widely used to derive mesopause temperatures and their variations. Since most data sets are only based on a fixed set of lines of a single band, it is important to know possible systematic uncertainties related to the choice of lines. Therefore, a comprehensive study of as many OH bands as possible is desirable. For this purpose, astronomical echelle spectrographs at large telescopes are the most suitable instruments. They offer a wide wavelength coverage, relatively high spectral resolution, and high sensitivity. Moreover, since each ground-based astronomical observation has an imprint of the Earth's atmosphere, the data archives of large astronomical facilities are a treasure for atmospheric studies. For our project, we used archival data of the medium-resolution X-shooter echelle spectrograph operated by the European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal in Chile. The instrument can simultaneously observe all OH bands that are accessible from ground. We reduced and analysed a set of 343 high-quality spectra taken between 2009 and 2013 to measure OH line intensities and to derive rotational and vibrational temperatures of 25 bands between 0.58 and 2.24 {$\mu$}m. We studied the influence of the selected line set, OH band, upper vibrational level v\&prime;, and the molecular data on the derived level populations and temperatures. The rotational temperature results indicate differences by several degrees depending on the selection. The temperatures for bands of even and odd v\&prime; show deviations which increase with v\&prime;. A study of the temporal variations revealed that the nocturnal variability pattern changes for v\&prime; from 2 to 9. In particular, the spread of temperatures tends to increase during the night, and the time of the minimum temperature depends on v\&prime;. The vibrational temperatures depend on the range of v\&prime; used for their determination, since the higher vibrational levels from 7 to 9 seem to be overpopulated compared to the lower levels. The vibrational temperature tends to increase during the night, while the intensity decreases. Our results support the assumption that the OH emission altitude depends on v\&prime;. Moreover, the emission layer appears to rise in the course of the night, which makes the OH thermalisation less efficient. The derived rotational temperatures and their change with v\&prime; seem to be significantly affected by non-equilibrium populations.},

The first supernova explosions have strong dynamical, thermal, and chemical feedback on the formation of subsequent stars and evolution of galaxies. However, the nature of the Universe's first stars and supernova explosions has not been well clarified. The signature of the nucleosynthesis yields of the first stars can be seen in the elemental abundance patterns observed in extremely metal-poor stars. Interestingly, those patterns show some peculiarities relative to the solar abundance pattern, which should provide important clues to understanding the nature of early generations of stars. We thus review the recent results of the nucleosynthesis yields of mainly massive stars for a wide range of stellar masses, metallicities, and explosion energies. We also provide yields tables and examine how those yields are affected by some hydrodynamical effects during supernova explosions, namely, explosion energies from those of hypernovae to faint supernovae, mixing and fallback of processed materials, asphericity, etc. Those parameters in the supernova nucleosynthesis models are constrained from observational data of supernovae and metal-poor stars. Nucleosynthesis yields are then applied to the chemical evolution model of our Galaxy and other types of galaxies to discuss how the chemical enrichment process occurred during evolution.},

Solar system exploration missions, such as Rosetta and Cassini, have given us further new insights. Meanwhile, the recent development of sophisticated models for isotope chemistry including detailed gas-phase and grain surface reaction network has made it possible to discuss how isotope fractionation in star and planet forming regions is imprinted into the icy mantles of dust grains, preserving a record of the initial isotopic state of solar system materials. This chapter reviews recent progress in observations of molecular isotopologues in extra-solar planet forming regions, prestellar/protostellar cores and protoplanetary disks, as well as objects in our solar system -- comets, meteorites, and planetary/satellite atmospheres -- and discusses their connection by means of isotope chemical models.},

Our {$\sim$}63 000 new, accurate radial-velocity observations for nearly 13 500 stars allow identification of most of the binary stars in the sample and, together with published uvby{$\beta$} photometry, Hipparcos parallaxes, Tycho-2 proper motions, and a few earlier radial velocities, complete the kinematic information for 14 139 stars. These high-quality velocity data are supplemented by effective temperatures and metallicities newly derived from recent and/or revised calibrations. The remaining stars either lack Hipparcos data or have fast rotation. A major effort has been devoted to the determination of new isochrone ages for all stars for which this is possible. Particular attention has been given to a realistic treatment of statistical biases and error estimates, as standard techniques tend to underestimate these effects and introduce spurious features in the age distributions. Our ages agree well with those by Edvardsson et al. ({\textbackslash}cite\{edv93\}), despite several astrophysical and computational improvements since then. We demonstrate, however, how strong observational and theoretical biases cause the distribution of the observed ages to be very different from that of the true age distribution of the sample. Among the many basic relations of the Galactic disk that can be reinvestigated from the data presented here, we revisit the metallicity distribution of the G dwarfs and the age-metallicity, age-velocity, and metallicity-velocity relations of the Solar neighbourhood. Our first results confirm the lack of metal-poor G dwarfs relative to closed-box model predictions (the ``G dwarf problem''), the existence of radial metallicity gradients in the disk, the small change in mean metallicity of the thin disk since its formation and the substantial scatter in metallicity at all ages, and the continuing kinematic heating of the thin disk with an efficiency consistent with that expected for a combination of spiral arms and giant molecular clouds. Distinct features in the distribution of the V component of the space motion are extended in age and metallicity, corresponding to the effects of stochastic spiral waves rather than classical moving groups, and may complicate the identification of thick-disk stars from kinematic criteria. More advanced analyses of this rich material will require careful simulations of the selection criteria for the sample and the distribution of observational errors.

We suppress and correct the systematic effects of the instrument, the telluric and stellar lines by using SYSREM algorithm after the selection of good orders based on Barnard star and other M-type stars. We detect a 4.8-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ signal at an orbital velocity of \$K\_\{p\}\$= +237.5 \${\textasciicircum}\{+13.0\}\_\{-5.0\}\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and systemic velocity \$V\_\{sys\}\$= -1.5 \${\textasciicircum}\{+4.0\} \_\{-10.5\}\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, which agree with the derived values from the previous analysis of primary transit. Our detection with the temperature inversion model implies the existence of stratosphere in its atmosphere, however, we were unable to constrain the volume-mixing ratio of the detected TiO. We also measure the stellar radial velocity and use it to obtain a more stringent constraint on the orbital velocity, \$K\_\{p\} = 239.0{\textasciicircum}\{+2.0\}\_\{-1.0\}\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Our results demonstrate that high-dispersion spectroscopy is a powerful tool to characterize the atmosphere of an exoplanet, even in the optical wavelength range, and show a promising potential in using and developing similar techniques with high-dispersion spectrograph on current 10m-class and future extremely large telescopes.},

We introduce a novel mixture of the experts outlier detection model, which uses a dynamically trained, weighted network of five distinct outlier detection methods. After dimensionality reduction, individual outlier detection methods score each data point for ``outlierness'' in this new feature space. Our model then uses dynamically trained parameters to weigh the scores of each method, allowing for a finalized outlier score. We find that the mixture of experts model performs, on average, better than any single expert model in identifying both artificially and manually picked outliers. This mixture model is applied to a data set of astronomical light curves, after dimensionality reduction via time series feature extraction. Our model was tested using three fields from the MACHO catalog and generated a list of anomalous candidates. We confirm that the outliers detected using this method belong to rare classes, like Novae, He-burning, and red giant stars; other outlier light curves identified have no available information associated with them. To elucidate their nature, we created a website containing the light-curve data and information about these objects. Users can attempt to classify the light curves, give conjectures about their identities, and sign up for follow up messages about the progress made on identifying these objects. This user submitted data can be used further train of our mixture of experts model. Our code is publicly available to all who are interested.},

Disk chemical structures are in their turn governed by a combination of in situ chemical processes, and inheritance of molecules from the preceding evolutionary stages of the star formation process. In this review we present our current understanding of the chemical processes active in pre- and protostellar environments that set the initial conditions for disks, and the disk chemical processes that evolve the chemical conditions during the first million years of planet formation. We review recent observational, laboratory and theoretical discoveries that have led to the present view of the chemical environment within which planets form, and their effects on the compositions of nascent planetary systems. We also discuss the many unknowns that remain and outline some possible pathways to addressing them.},

  abstract = {Planetary bodies form by accretion of smaller bodies. It has been suggested that a very efficient way to grow protoplanets is by accreting particles of size km (e.g., chondrules, boulders, or fragments of larger bodies) as they can be kept dynamically cold. We investigate the effects of gas drag on the impact radii and the accretion rates of these particles. As simplifying assumptions we restrict our analysis to 2D settings, a gas drag law linear in velocity, and a laminar disk characterized by a smooth (global) pressure gradient that causes particles to drift in radially. These approximations, however, enable us to cover an arbitrary large parameter space. The framework of the circularly restricted three body problem is used to numerically integrate particle trajectories and to derive their impact parameters. Three accretion modes can be distinguished: hyperbolic encounters, where the 2-body gravitational focusing enhances the impact parameter; three-body encounters, where gas drag enhances the capture probability; and settling encounters, where particles settle towards the protoplanet. An analysis of the observed behavior is presented; and we provide a recipe to analytically calculate the impact radius, which confirms the numerical findings. We apply our results to the sweepup of fragments by a protoplanet at a distance of 5 AU. Accretion of debris on small protoplanets ({$<\sim$}50 km) is found to be slow, because the fragments are distributed over a rather thick layer. However, the newly found settling mechanism, which is characterized by much larger impact radii, becomes relevant for protoplanets of {$\sim$}103 km in size and provides a much faster channel for growth.},

The configuration confounds theorists as the planets are not easily explained by either in situ or migration models. In this paper we present a scenario for the formation and orbital architecture of the TRAPPIST-1 system. In our model, planet formation starts at the H2O iceline, where pebble-sized particles whose origin is the outer disk accumulate to trigger streaming instabilities. After their formation, planetary embryos quickly mature by pebble accretion. Planet growth stalls at Earth masses, where the planet's gravitational feedback on the disk keeps pebbles at bay. Planets are transported by type I migration to the inner disk, where they stall at the magnetospheric cavity and end up in mean motion resonances. During disk dispersal, the cavity radius expands and the innermost planets escape resonance. We argue that the model outlined here can also be applied to other compact systems and that the many close-in super-Earth systems are a scaled-up version of TRAPPIST-1. We also hypothesize that few close-in compact systems harbor giant planets at large distances, since they would have stopped the pebble flux from the outer disk.},

The planet formation process takes place in the interior of dusty disks, which offer us only limited observational constraints. Historically, the two main paradigms describing planet formation are the disk instability and core accretion models. In the former giant planets condense directly form a disk massive enough to fragments under its own self-gravity. In contrast, the core accretion model follows a bottom-up approach driven by the growth of solid bodies. The core accretion model includes the direct growth phase, where pebble and possibly planetesimal sized bodies form by surface-driven processes. Alternatively, planetesimal bodies can emerge from instabilities in the solid population, leading to the formation of clumps that ultimately collapse. The later stages of the core accretion model involve the emergence of protoplanets from the planetesimal population, which accretes smaller bodies{\textbar}planetesimals or pebbles{\textbar}before ultimately accreting freely the gas of the disk. In this Chapter I will review these formation mechanisms, aiming, where possible, to build an intuitive understanding from elementary physical principles.},

  abstract = {Brown Dwarfs (BDs) are crucial objects in our understanding of both star and planet formation. However, there is still an unconcluded debate about which is the dominant formation mechanism of these objects. For this, it is mandatory to study BDs in their earliest evolutionary stages (what we call pre- and proto-BDs), comparable to the `pre-stellar' and `Class 0/I' stages well characterized for the formation of low-mass stars. In this review, the recent efforts aimed at searching, identifying and characterising pre- and proto-BD candidates in nearby star-forming regions are presented, and revised requirements for an object to be a promising proto-BD or pre-BD candidate are provided, based on a new, unexplored so far, relation between the internal luminosity and the accreted mass. By applying these requirements, a list of 67 promising proto-BD candidates is presented, along with a compilation of possible pre-BDs from the literature. Updated correlations of protostellar properties such as mass infall rate or outflow momentum rate with bolometric luminosity are provided down to the low-mass BD regime, where no significant deviations are apparent. Furthermore, the number of proto-BD candidates in different clouds of the Solar Neighborhood seem to follow the known relations of number of protostars with cloud properties. In addition, proto(star-to-BD) ratios for the different clouds are also explored, unveiling a particular underproduction of low-mass proto-BD candidates in Ophiuchus compared to Lupus and Taurus. Possible explanations for this behavior are discussed, including heating of the Ophiuchus cloud by the nearby OB stars. The overall results of this work tend to favor a star-like process for BD formation down to the planetary boundary, of about 10 Mjup, below which other mechanisms might be at work.},

  abstract = {Context. About a year ago, a super-Jovian planet was directly imaged around the nearby young solar-type star AF Lep. The 2.8 MJup planet orbiting at a semimajor axis of 8.2 au matches the predicted location based on the HIPPARCOS-Gaia astrometric acceleration. Aims: Our aim is to expand the atmospheric exploration of AF Lep b by modeling all available observations obtained with SPHERE at VLT (in the range 0.95-1.65, at 2.105, and at 2.253 {\textmu}m), and NIRC2 at Keck (at 3.8 {\textmu}m) with self-consistent atmospheric models. Methods: To understand the physical properties of this exoplanet, we used ForMoSA. This forward-modeling code compares observations with grids of pre-computed synthetic atmospheric spectra using Bayesian inference methods. We used Exo-REM, an atmospheric radiative-convective equilibrium model, including the effects of nonequilibrium processes and clouds. Results: From the atmospheric modeling we derived solutions at the low Teff of {\textasciitilde}750 K. Our analysis also favors a metal-rich atmosphere ({$>$}0.4) and solar to super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio ({\textasciitilde}0.6). We tested the robustness of the estimated values for each parameter by cross-validating our models using the leave-one-out strategy, where all points are used iteratively as validation points. Our results indicate that the photometry point at 3.8 {\textmu}m strongly drives the metal-rich and super-solar carbon-to-oxygen solutions. Conclusions: Our atmospheric forward-modeling analysis strongly supports the planetary nature of AF Lep b. Its spectral energy distribution is consistent with that of a young, cold, early-T super-Jovian planet. We recover physically consistent solutions for the surface gravity and radius, which allows us to reconcile atmospheric forward modeling with evolutionary models, in agreement with the previously published complementary analysis done by retrievals. Finally, we identified that future data at longer wavelengths are necessary before we can conclude about the metal-rich nature of AF Lep b.},

We based this study on a rich set of observations, which allows us to investigate its orbital and atmospheric properties.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. We composed a spectrum of AB Pic b by merging archival medium-resolution ({\textasciitilde}4000) VLT/SINFONI K band (1.96--2.45 {\textmu}m) data with published spectra at \emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$} and \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$} bands from SINFONI, \emph{Lp{$<$}i/{$>$} band from Magellan-AO/CLIO2, and photometric measurements from HST (visible) and \emph{Spitzer{$<$}i/{$>$} (mid-infrared). We modeled the spectrum with ForMoSA, following a forward-modeling approach based on two atmospheric models: ExoREM and BT-SETTL13. In parallel, we determined the orbital properties of AB Pic b fitting orbital solutions to astrometric measurements from NaCo (2003 and 2004) and SPHERE (2015).\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. The orbital solutions favor a semi-major axis of au on a highly inclined orbit (edge-on), but with a poorly constrained eccentricity. From the atmospheric modeling with Exo-REM, we derive an effective temperature of 1700 {\textpm} 50 K and surface gravity of 4.5 {\textpm} 0.3 dex, which are consistent with previous findings, and we report for the first time a ratio of 0.58 {\textpm} 0.08, consistent with the value for the Sun.

Given the published rotation period of 2.1 h and our derived \emph{{$\upsilon<$}i/{$>$}sin(\emph{i{$<$}i/{$>$}) of km s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, we estimate for the first time the true obliquity of AB Pic b to be between 45 and 135 deg, indicating a rather significant misalignment between the spin and orbit orientations of the planet. Finally, the existence of a proper-motion anomaly between the HIPPARCOS and \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} Early Data Release 3 compared to our SPHERE detection limits and adapted radial velocity limits indicates the potential existence of a {\textasciitilde}6 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{Jup{$<$}sub/{$>$} inner planet orbiting from 2 to 10 au (40--200 mas).\emph{Conclusions{$<$}i/{$>$}. The possible existence of an inner companion and the likely misalignment of the spin-axis orientation strongly favor a formation path by gravitational instability or core accretion within a protoplanetary disk at a smaller orbital radius followed by a dynamical interaction which scattered AB Pic b to its current location. Confirmation and characterization of this unseen inner exoplanet and access to a broader wavelength coverage and higher spectral resolution for the characterization of AB Picb will be essential for probing the uncertainties associated with the atmospheric and orbital parameters.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

In order to explore the optimal disk conditions for giant planet, we performed \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}-body simulations to investigate the growth and dynamical evolution of both single and multiple protoplanets in the disks with both inner viscously heated and outer stellar irradiated regions. The initial masses of the protoplanets are either assumed to be equal to 0.01 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$} or calculated based on the formula derived from streaming instability simulations. Our findings indicate that massive planets are more likely to form in disks with longer lifetimes, higher solid masses, moderate to high levels of disk turbulence, and larger initial masses of protoplanets. In the single protoplanet growth cases, the highest planet core mass that can be reached is generally lower than the threshold necessary to trigger rapid gas accretion, which impedes the formation of giant planets. Nonetheless, in multi-protoplanet cases, the cores can exceed the pebble isolation mass barrier aided by frequent planet--planet collisions. This consequently speeds their gas accretion up and promotes giant planet formation, making the optimal parameter space to grow giant planets substantially wider. Taken together, our results suggest that even around very-low-mass stellar hosts, the giant planets with orbital periods of {$\lessequivlnt$}100 days are still likely to form when lunar-mass protoplanets first emerge from planetesimal accretion and then grow rapidly by a combination of pebble accretion and planet--planet collisions in disks with a high supply of a pebble reservoir {$>$}50 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$} and a turbulent level of \emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{t{$<$}sub/{$>$} {\textasciitilde} 10\textsuperscript{-3{$<$}sup/{$>-$}10\textsuperscript{-2{$<$}sup/{$>$}.}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

This work discusses the active sample without close binary companions, providing a comprehensive picture of these 123 stars with H{$\alpha$} emission stronger than -1 {\AA}. Our analysis includes rotation periods (including 31 new measurements), H{$\alpha$} equivalent widths, rotational broadening, inclinations, and radial velocities, determined using high-resolution, multiepoch spectroscopic data from the TRES and CHIRON spectrographs supplemented by photometry from TESS and MEarth. Using this volume-complete sample, we establish that the majority of active, low-mass M dwarfs are very rapid rotators: specifically, 74\% {\textpm} 4\% have rotation periods shorter than 2 days, while 19\% {\textpm} 4\% have intermediate rotation periods of 2--20 days, and the remaining 8\% {\textpm} 3\% have periods longer than 20 days. Among the latter group, we identify a population of stars with very high H{$\alpha$} emission, which we suggest is indicative of dramatic spindown as these stars transition from the rapidly rotating mode to the slowly rotating one. We are unable to determine rotation periods for six stars and suggest that some of the stars without measured rotation periods may be viewed pole-on, as such stars are absent from the distribution of inclinations we measure; this lack notwithstanding, we recover the expected isotropic distribution of spin axes. Our spectroscopic and photometric data sets also allow us to investigate activity-induced radial-velocity variability, which we show can be estimated as the product of rotational broadening and the photometric amplitude of spot modulation.},

  abstract = {M dwarfs remain active over longer timescales than their Sunlike counterparts, with potentially devastating implications for the atmospheres of their planets. However, the age at which fully convective M dwarfs transition from active and rapidly rotating to quiescent and slowly rotating is poorly understood, as these stars remain rapidly rotating in the oldest clusters that are near enough for a large sample of low-mass M dwarfs to be studied. To constrain the spindown of these low-mass stars, we measure photometric rotation periods for field M dwarfs in wide binary systems, primarily using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and MEarth. Our analysis includes M--M pairs, which are coeval but of unknown age, as well as M dwarfs with white dwarf or Sunlike primaries, for which we can estimate ages using techniques like white-dwarf cooling curves, gyrochronology, and lithium abundance. We find that the epoch of spindown is strongly dependent on mass. Fully convective M dwarfs initially spin down slowly, with the population of 0.2--0.3 M {$\odot$} rapid rotators evolving from P rot {$<$} 2 days at 600 Myr to 2 {$<$} P rot {$<$} 10 days at 1--3 Gyr before rapidly spinning down to long rotation periods at older ages. However, we also identify some variability in the spindown of fully convective M dwarfs, with a small number of stars having substantially spun down by 600 Myr. These observations are consistent with models of magnetic morphology-driven spindown, where angular momentum loss is initially inefficient until changes in the magnetic field allow spindown to progress rapidly.},

With its aim to search for habitable planets around M dwarfs, several planets of different masses have been detected. The characterization of the target sample is important for the ability to derive and constrain the physical properties of any planetary systems that are detected. As a continuation of previous work in this context, we derived the fundamental stellar parameters effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity of the CARMENES M-dwarf targets from PHOENIX model fits using a {$\chi$}2 method. We calculated updated PHOENIX stellar atmosphere models that include a new equation of state to especially account for spectral features of low-temperature stellar atmospheres as well as new atomic and molecular line lists. We show the importance of selecting magnetically insensitive lines for fitting to avoid effects of stellar activity in the line profiles. For the first time, we directly compare stellar parameters derived from multiwavelength range spectra, simultaneously observed for the same star. In comparison with literature values we show that fundamental parameters derived from visible spectra and visible and NIR spectra combined are in better agreement than those derived from the same spectra in the NIR alone.

  abstract = {Deriving metallicities for solar-like stars follows well-established methods, but for cooler stars such as M dwarfs, the determination is much more complicated due to forests of molecular lines that are present. Several methods have been developed in recent years to determine accurate stellar parameters for these cool stars (\emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 4000 K). However, significant differences can be found at times when comparing metallicities for the same star derived using different methods. In this work, we determine the effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities of 18 well-studied M dwarfs observed with the CARMENES high-resolution spectrograph following different approaches, including synthetic spectral fitting, analysis of pseudo-equivalent widths, and machine learning. We analyzed the discrepancies in the derived stellar parameters, including metallicity, in several analysis runs. Our goal is to minimize these discrepancies and find stellar parameters that are more consistent with the literature values. We attempted to achieve this consistency by standardizing the most commonly used components, such as wavelength ranges, synthetic model spectra, continuum normalization methods, and stellar parameters. We conclude that although such modifications work quite well for hotter main-sequence stars, they do not improve the consistency in stellar parameters for M dwarfs, leading to mean deviations of around 50--200 K in temperature and 0.1--0.3 dex in metallicity. In particular, M dwarfs are much more complex and a standardization of the aforementioned components cannot be considered as a straightforward recipe for bringing consistency to the derived parameters. Further in-depth investigations of the employed methods would be necessary in order to identify and correct for the discrepancies that remain.}}},

The core accretion model predicts that giant planets cannot form around low-mass M dwarfs, although this idea has been challenged by recent planet discoveries. Here, we investigate the occurrence rate of giant planets around low-mass (0.1--0.3 M {$\odot$}) M dwarfs. We monitor a volume-complete, inactive sample of 200 such stars located within 15 pc, collecting four high-resolution spectra of each M dwarf over six years and performing intensive follow-up monitoring of two candidate radial velocity variables. We use TRES on the 1.5 m telescope at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory and CHIRON on the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 1.5 m telescope for our primary campaign, and MAROON-X on Gemini-North for high-precision follow up. We place a 95\% confidence upper limit of 1.5\% (68\% confidence limit of 0.57\%) on the occurrence of M P sin i {$>$} 1 M J giant planets out to the water snow line and provide additional constraints on the giant planet population as a function of M P sin i and period.

We modelled spectra of two M dwarfs, GJ 15A (M1V) and GJ 15B (M3 V), to determine Ti isotopic ratios in their atmospheres. Results. We demonstrate the accuracy of the ExoMol TOTO line list for different isotopologues of TiO and the possibility of determining accurate Ti isotope abundances in a number of spectral ranges. The 7580--7594 {\AA} spectral range seems particularly useful, with two atomic lines of Fe I and molecular band heads of 50Ti O, 49Ti O, 48Ti O, and 47Ti O clearly observable in our two M-dwarf spectra. We determine non-solar Ti isotopic ratios of 46Ti, 47Ti, 48Ti, 49Ti, and 50Ti of 7.9, 5.2, 72.8, 7.9, and 6.2 for GJ 15A and 7.4, 4.2, 76.6, 5.8, and 6.0 for GJ 15B with an accuracy of {\textpm}0.2.

  abstract = {A key outstanding question in star and planet formation is how far the initial mass function of stars and sub-stellar objects extends, and whether or not there is a cut-off at the very lowest masses. Isolated objects in the planetary-mass domain below 13 Jupiter masses, where not even deuterium can fuse, are very challenging to observe as these objects are inherently faint. Nearby star-forming regions provide the best opportunity to search for them though: while they are young, they are still relatively warm and luminous at infrared wavelengths. Previous surveys have discovered a handful of such sources down to 3--5 Jupiter masses, around the minimum mass limit established for formation via the fragmentation of molecular clouds, but does the mass function extend further? In a new James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared survey of the inner Orion Nebula and Trapezium Cluster, we have discovered and characterised a sample of 540 planetary-mass candidates with masses down to 0.6 Jupiter masses, demonstrating that there is indeed no sharp cut-off in the mass function. Furthermore, we find that 9{\textbackslash}\% of the planetary-mass objects are in wide binaries, a result that is highly unexpected and which challenges current theories of both star and planet formation.},

  abstract = {We present results of a spectroscopic survey for new K- and M-type members of Scorpius--Centaurus (Sco--Cen), the nearest OB Association ({$\sim$}100--200 pc). Using an X-ray, proper motion and colour--magnitude selected sample, we obtained spectra for 361 stars, for which we report spectral classifications and Li and H{$\alpha$} equivalent widths. We identified 156 new members of Sco--Cen, and recovered 51 previously published members. We have combined these with previously known members to form a sample of 493 solar-mass ({$\sim$}0.7--1.3 M ) members of Sco--Cen. We investigated the star formation history of this sample, and reassessed the ages of the massive main-sequence turn-off and the G-type members in all three subgroups. We performed a census for circumstellar discs in our sample using WISE infrared data and find a protoplanetary disc fraction for K-type stars of 4.4+-10..69 per cent for Upper Centaurus-Lupus and Lower Centaurus-Crux at {$\sim$}16 Myr and 9.0+-42..02 per cent for Upper Scorpius at {$\sim$}10 Myr. These data are consistent with a protoplanetary disc e-folding time-scale of {$\sim$}4--5 Myr for {$\sim$}1 M stars, twice that previously quoted, but consistent with the Bell et al. revised age scale of young clusters. Finally, we construct an age map of Scorpius--Centaurus which clearly reveals substructure consisting of concentrations of younger and older stars. We find evidence for strong age gradients within all three subgroups. None of the subgroups are consistent with being simple, coeval populations which formed in single bursts, but likely represents a multitude of smaller star formation episodes of hundreds to tens of stars each.},

  abstract = {In recent years, several planets have been discovered at wide orbits ({$>$}100 AU) around their host stars. Theoretical studies encounter difficulties in explaining their formation and origin. Here we propose a novel scenario for the production of planetary systems at such orbits, through the dynamical recapture of free floating planets (FFPs) in dispersing stellar clusters and stellar associations. This process is a natural extension of the recently suggested scenario for the formation of wide stellar binaries. We use N-body simulations of dispersing clusters with 10--1000 stars and comparable numbers of FFPs to study this process. We find that planets are captured into wide orbits in the typical range {$\sim$}few {\texttimes} 100--106 AU and have a wide range of eccentricities (thermal distribution). Typically, 3--6 {\texttimes} (fFFP/1)\% of all stars capture a planetary companion with such properties (where fFFP is the number of FFP per star in the birth clusters). The planetary capture efficiency is comparable to that of capture-formed stellar binaries, and shows a similar dependence on the cluster size and structure. It is almost independent of the specific planetary mass; planets as well as substellar companions of any mass can be captured. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. We also find that more than one planet can be captured around the same host through independent consecutive captures; similarly, planets can be captured into binary systems, both in circumstellar and circumbinary orbits. We also expect planets to be captured into pre-existing planetary (and protoplanetary systems) as well as into orbits around black holes and massive white dwarfs, if these formed early enough before the cluster dispersal. In particular, stellar black holes have a high capture efficiency ({$>$}50\% and 5--10 {\texttimes} (fFFP/1)\% for capture of stars and planetary companions, respectively) due to their large mass. Finally, although rare, two FFPs or brown dwarfs can become bound and form an FFP-binary system with no stellar host.},

In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of this data set utilizing a forward-modeling approach applying our Bayesian framework, ForMoSA. We explore five distinct atmospheric models to assess their performance in estimating key atmospheric parameters: T eff, log(g), [M/H], C/O, {$\gamma$}, f sed, and R. Our findings reveal that each parameter's estimate is significantly influenced by factors such as the wavelength range considered and the model chosen for the fit. This is attributed to systematic errors in the models and their challenges in accurately replicating the complex atmospheric structure of VHS 1256 b, notably the complexity of its clouds and dust distribution. To propagate the impact of these systematic uncertainties on our atmospheric property estimates, we introduce innovative fitting methodologies based on independent fits performed on different spectral windows. We finally derived a T eff consistent with the spectral type of the target, considering its young age, which is confirmed by our estimate of log(g). Despite the exceptional data quality, attaining robust estimates for chemical abundances [M/H] and C/O, often employed as indicators of formation history, remains challenging. Nevertheless, the pioneering case of JWST's data for VHS 1256 b has paved the way for future acquisitions of substellar spectra that will be systematically analyzed to directly compare the properties of these objects and correct the systematics in the models.},

The object is also re-detected with the so-called               ``molecular mapping''               technique. The technique yields consistent atmospheric parameters, but the loss of the planet pseudo-continuum in the process degrades or modifies the constraints on these parameters. The solar to sub-solar C/O ratio suggests an enrichment by solids at formation if the planet was formed beyond the water snowline ({$\geq$}20 au) by core accretion (CA hereafter). However, a formation by gravitational instability (GI hereafter) cannot be ruled out. The metallicity is compatible with the bulk enrichment of massive Jovian planets from the Bern planet population models. Finally, we measure a radial velocity of 26 {\textpm} 15 km s               -1               compatible with our revised measurement on the star. This is the fourth imaged exoplanet for which a radial velocity can be evaluated, illustrating the potential of such observations for assessing the coevolution of imaged systems belonging to star forming regions, such as HIP 65426.},

They do not reproduce consistently the optical spectrum and the depth of the K I doublets in the J-band. We derive Teff = 1380+/-54 K, log(g) = 3.97+/-0.48 dex, [M/H] = 0.21+/-0.29, and C/O {$>$} 0.63. Our inversion of the HST/WFC3 spectra suggests a relative change of 27+6-5 K of the disk-integrated Teff correlated with the near-infrared brightness. Our data anchor the characterization of that object in the near-infrared and could be used jointly to the ERS mid-infrared data to provide the most detailed characterization of an ultracool dwarf to date.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the C/O ratio in brown dwarfs are lacking, in part due to past models adopting solar C/O only. We have expanded the ATMO 2020 atmosphere model grid to include nonsolar metallicities and C/O ratios in the T dwarf regime. We change the C/O ratio by altering either the carbon or oxygen elemental abundances, and we find that nonsolar abundances of these elements can be distinguished based on the shapes of the H and K bands. We compare these new models with medium-resolution (R {$\approx$} 1700), near-infrared (0.8--2.4 {$\mu$}m) Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) spectra of three benchmark late-T dwarfs, GJ 570D, HD 3651B, and Ross 458C. We find solar C/O ratios and best-fitting parameters (T eff, , Z) broadly consistent with other analyses in the literature based on low-resolution (R {$\sim$} 100) data. The model-data discrepancies in the near-infrared spectra are consistent across all three objects. These discrepancies are alleviated when fitting the Y, J, H, and K bands individually, but the resulting best-fit parameters are inconsistent and disagree with the results from the full spectrum. By examining the model atmosphere properties we find this is due to the interplay of gravity and metallicity on H2--H2 collisionally induced absorption. We therefore conclude that there are no significant issues with the molecular opacity tables used in the models at this spectral resolution. Instead, deficiencies are more likely to lie in the model assumptions regarding the thermal structures. Finally, we find a discrepancy between the GNIRS, SpeX, and other near-infrared spectra in the literature of Ross 458C, indicating potential spectroscopic variability.},

Atmosphere models are generated with our state-of-the-art 1D radiative-convective equilibrium code ATMO, and are used as surface boundary conditions to calculate the interior structure and evolution of 0.001--0.075 M objects. Our models include several key improvements to the input physics used in previous models available in the literature. Most notably, the use of a new H--He equation of state including ab initio quantum molecular dynamics calculations has raised the mass by {$\sim$}1-2\% at the stellar--substellar boundary and has altered the cooling tracks around the hydrogen and deuterium burning minimum masses. A second key improvement concerns updated molecular opacities in our atmosphere model ATMO, which now contains significantly more line transitions required to accurately capture the opacity in these hot atmospheres. This leads to warmer atmospheric temperature structures, further changing the cooling curves and predicted emission spectra of substellar objects. We present significant improvement for the treatment of the collisionally broadened potassium resonance doublet, and highlight the importance of these lines in shaping the red-optical and near-infrared spectrum of brown dwarfs. We generate three different grids of model simulations, one using equilibrium chemistry and two using non-equilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing, all three computed self-consistently with the pressuretemperature structure of the atmosphere. We show the impact of vertical mixing on emission spectra and in colour-magnitude diagrams, highlighting how the 3.5-5.5 {\textmu}m flux window can be used to calibrate vertical mixing in cool T--Y spectral type objects.},

In a separate analysis, we determined the 12C/13C of GQ Lup A using isotope-dependent PHOENIX models. Results. We determined the abundances of spectrally active species in the atmosphere of GQ Lup B, including H2O and 12CO, along with trace species 13CO, HF, Na, Ca, and Ti. Additionally, we derived a C/O ratio of 0.50 {\textpm} 0.01, consistent with the solar value ({$\sim$}0.59) and we measured a carbon isotope ratio of 12C/13C = 53+-76. Similarly, GQ Lup A exhibited a 12C/13C of 51+-180, aligning closely with the value observed in GQ Lup B. Furthermore, we identified strong veiling of the photospheric lines in the spectrum of GQ Lup A, which we include in our analysis. Conclusions. The similar 12C/13C values in GQ Lup B and GQ Lup A suggest a common origin from the same material reservoir, supporting the theory that the companion formed via disk fragmentation or gravitational collapse.},

These two clouds host clumps at different stages of evolution, including a massive dense clump in both clouds that is dark even at 70 and 100 {\textmu}m. Such seemingly quiescent massive dense clumps have been speculated to harbor cores that are precursors of high-mass stars and clusters. We observed these two ``prestellar'' regions at 1 mm with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) with the aim of characterizing the nature of such cores. We show that the clumps fragment into several low- to high-mass cores within the filamentary structure of the enveloping cloud. However, while the overall physical properties of the clump may indicate a starless phase, we find that both regions host multiple outflows. The most massive core though 70 {\textmu}m dark in both clumps is clearly associated with compact outflows. Such low-luminosity, massive cores are potentially the earliest stage in the evolution of a massive protostar. We also identify several outflow features distributed in the large environment around the most massive core. We infer that these outflows are being powered by young, low-mass protostars whose core mass is below our detection limit. These findings suggest that low-mass protostars have already formed or are coevally formed at the earliest phase of high-mass star formation.},

It also includes specific tools for extracting data for spectrum synthesis and model atmosphere calculations.

The data base is presently restricted to spectral lines which are relevant for stars in which the LTE approximation is sufficient and molecular lines do not have to be taken into account.

We explore the effect of the radial drift of solids and viscous gas accretion onto the central star on the snowline locations of the main C and O carriers in a protoplanetary disk, H2O, CO2, and CO, and their consequences for the C/O ratio in gas and dust throughout the disk. We determine the snowline locations for a range of fixed initial particle sizes and disk types. For our fiducial disk model, we find that grains with sizes {$\sim$}0.5 cm  s  7 m for an irradiated disk and {$\sim$}0.001 cm  s  7 m for an evolving and viscous disk desorb at a size-dependent location in the disk, which is independent of the particle's initial position. The snowline radius decreases for larger particles, up to sizes of {$\sim$}7m. Compared to a static disk, we find that radial drift and gas accretion in a viscous disk move the H2O snowline inwards by up to 40\%, the CO2 snowline by up to 60\%, and the CO snowline by up to 50\%. We thus determine an inner limit on the snowline locations when radial drift and gas accretion are accounted for.},

  abstract = {The SuperWASP cameras are wide-field imaging systems at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands, and at the Sutherland Station of the South African Astronomical Observatory. Each instrument has a field of view of some 482 deg2 with an angular scale of 13{\cyrchar\CYRLJE}.7 pixelϪ1, and is capable of delivering photometry with accuracy better than 1\% for objects having V {$\sim$} 7.0--11.5. Lower quality data for objects brighter than V {$\sim$} 15.0 are stored in the project archive. The systems, while designed to monitor fields with high cadence, are capable of surveying the entire visible sky every 40 minutes. Depending on the observational strategy, the data rate can be up to 100 Gbytes per night. We have produced a robust, largely automatic reduction pipeline and advanced archive, which are used to serve the data products to the consortium members. The main science aim of these systems is to search for bright transiting exoplanet systems suitable for spectroscopic follow-up observations. The first 6 month season of SuperWASPNorth observations produced light curves of {$\sim$}6.7 million objects with 12.9 billion data points.},

The simulations combine three elements: (1) three-body accretion cross sections of solids onto an isolated planetary embryo, (2) a stellar evolution code for the planet's gaseous envelope, and (3) a planetesimal dissolution code within the envelope, used to evaluate the planet's effective capture radius and the energy deposition profile of accreted material. Major assumptions include: The planet is embedded in a disk of gas and small planetesimals with locally uniform initial surface mass density, and planetesimals are not allowed to migrate into or out of the planet's feeding zone. All simulations are characterized by three major phases. During the first phase, the planet's mass consists primarily of solid material. The planetesimal accretion rate, which dominates that of gas, rapidly increases owing to runaway accretion, then decreases as the planet's feeding zone is depleted. During the second phase, both solid and gas accretion rates are small and nearly independent of time. The third phase, marked by runaway gas accretion, starts when the solid and gas masses are about equal. It is engendered by a strong positive feedback on the gas accretion rates, driven by the rapid contraction of the gaseous envelope and the rapid expansion of the outer boundary, which depends on the planet's total mass. The overall evolutionary time scale is generally determined by the length of the second phase. The actual rates at which the giant planets accreted small planetesimals is probably intermediate between the constant rates assumed in most previous studies and the highly variable rates used here. Within the context of the adopted model of planetesimal accretion, the joint constraints of the time scale for dissipation of the solar nebula and the current high-Zmasses of the giant planets lead to estimates of the initial surface density ({$\sigma$}init) of planetesimals in the outer region of the solar nebula. The results show that {$\sigma$}init{$\approx$} 10 g cm-2near Jupiter's orbit and that {$\sigma$}init{$\propto$}a-2, whereais the distance from the Sun. These values are a factor of 3 to 4 times as high as that of the ``minimum-mass'' solar nebula at Jupiter's distance and a factor of 2 to 3 times as high at Saturn's distance. The estimates for the formation time of Jupiter and Saturn are 1 to 10 million years, whereas those for Uranus fall in the range 2 to 16 million years. These estimates follow from the properties of our Solar System and do not necessarily apply to giant planets in other planetary systems.},

The calculations employ newly constructed potential energy surfaces (PES), which take advantage of a novel method for using the large set of experimental energy levels for H216O to give high-quality predictions for H218O and H217O. This procedure greatly extends the energy range for which a PES can be accurately determined, allowing an accurate prediction of higher lying energy levels than are currently known from direct laboratory measurements. This PES is combined with a high-accuracy, ab initio dipole moment surface of water in the computation of all energy levels, transition frequencies and associated Einstein A coefficients for states with rotational excitation up to J~=~50 and energies up to 30~000~cm-1. The resulting HotWat78 line lists complement the well-used BT2 H216O line list. Full line lists are made available online as Supporting Information and at www.exomol.com.},

The final line list comprises all energy levels up to 41 000~cm-1 and rotational angular momentum J up to 72. An accurate ab\,initio dipole moment surface was used for the calculation of line intensities and reproduces high-precision experimental intensity data with an accuracy close to 1\,per\,cent. The final line list uses empirical energy levels, whenever they are available, to ensure that line positions are reproduced as accurately as possible.

  abstract = {The recent inference of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere of the hot (approximately 1,100\,K), Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b from near-infrared JWST observations1--3 suggests that photochemistry is a key process in high-temperature exoplanet atmospheres4. This is because of the low ({$<$}1\,ppb) abundance of SO2 under thermochemical equilibrium compared with that produced from the photochemistry of H2O and H2S (1--10\,ppm)4--9. However, the SO2 inference was made from a single, small molecular feature in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b at 4.05\,{$\mu$}m and, therefore, the detection of other SO2 absorption bands at different wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO2 abundance. Here we report the detection of SO2 spectral features at 7.7 and 8.5\,{$\mu$}m in the 5--12-{$\mu$}m transmission spectrum of WASP-39b measured by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS)10. Our observations suggest an abundance of SO2 of 0.5--25\,ppm (1{$\sigma$} range), consistent with previous findings4. As well as SO2, we find broad water-vapour absorption features, as well as an unexplained decrease in the transit depth at wavelengths longer than 10\,{$\mu$}m. Fitting the spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward models, we derive an atmospheric heavy-element content (metallicity) for WASP-39b of approximately 7.1--8.0 times solar and demonstrate that photochemistry shapes the spectra of WASP-39b across a broad wavelength range.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the abundance evolution of the elements from H to U in the Milky Way halo and local disc. We use a consistent chemical evolution model, metallicity-dependent isotopic yields from low and intermediate mass stars and yields from massive stars which include, for the first time, the combined effect of metallicity, mass loss, and rotation for a large grid of stellar masses and for all stages of stellar evolution. The yields of massive stars are weighted by a metallicity-dependent function of the rotational velocities, constrained by observations as to obtain a primary-like 14N behaviour at low metallicity and to avoid overproduction of s-elements at intermediate metallicities. We show that the Solar system isotopic composition can be reproduced to better than a factor of 2 for isotopes up to the Fe-peak, and at the 10\,per\,cent level for most pure s-isotopes, both light ones (resulting from the weak s-process in rotating massive stars) and the heavy ones (resulting from the main s-process in low and intermediate mass stars). We conclude that the light element primary process (LEPP), invoked to explain the apparent abundance deficiency of the s-elements with A~\&lt;~100, is not necessary. We also reproduce the evolution of the heavy to light s-elements abundance ratio ([hs/ls]) -- recently observed in unevolved thin disc stars -- as a result of the contribution of rotating massive stars at sub-solar metallicities. We find that those stars produce primary F and dominate its solar abundance and we confirm their role in the observed primary behaviour of N. In contrast, we show that their action is insufficient to explain the small observed values of \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{12\}C/{\textasciicircum}\{13\}C\$ in halo red giants, which is rather due to internal processes in those stars.},

The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international \emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. \emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of \emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate \emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the \emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}Archive, which is available through the \emph{Gaia {$<$}i/{$>$}home page.}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy is still the preferred characterization technique for exoplanet atmospheres, although it presents unique challenges that translate into characterization bottlenecks when robust mitigation strategies are missing. Stellar contamination is one such challenge that can overpower the planetary signal by up to an order of magnitude, and thus not accounting for it can lead to significant biases in the derived atmospheric properties. Yet this accounting may not be straightforward, as important discrepancies exist between state-of-the-art stellar models and measured spectra and between models themselves. Here we explore the extent to which stellar models can be used to reliably correct for stellar contamination and yield a planet's uncontaminated transmission spectrum. We find that discrepancies between stellar models can significantly contribute to the noise budget of JWST transmission spectra of planets around stars with heterogeneous photospheres, the true number of unique photospheric spectral components and their properties can only be accurately retrieved when the stellar models have sufficient fidelity, and under such optimistic circumstances the contribution of stellar contamination to the noise budget of a transmission spectrum is considerably below that of the photon noise for the standard transit observation setup. Therefore, we advocate for further development of model spectra of stars and their active regions in a data-driven manner, empirical approaches for deriving spectra of photospheric components using the observatories with which the atmospheric explorations are carried out, and analysis techniques accounting for multimodal posterior distributions for photospheric parameters of interest, which will be increasingly revealed by precise JWST measurements.},

  abstract = {Gravitational instability has been invoked as a possible mechanism of the giant planet production in protoplanetary disks. Here we critically revise its viability by noting that to form planets directly, it is not enough for protoplanetary disks to be gravitationally unstable. They must also be able to cool efficiently (on a timescale comparable to the local disk orbital period) to allow the formation of the bound clumps by fragmentation. A combination of the dynamical and thermal constraints puts very stringent lower limits on the properties of disks capable of fragmenting into the self-gravitating objects: for the gravitational instability to form giant planets at 10 AU in the disk cooled by the radiation transfer, the gas temperature must exceed 103 K with a minimum disk mass of 0.7 M, and a luminosity of 40 L,. Although these requirements are relaxed in the more distant parts of the disk, masses of the bound objects formed as a result of instability are too large even at 100 AU ({$\sim$}10MJ) to explain the characteristics of known extrasolar giant planets. Such protoplanetary disks (and planets formed in them) have very unusual observational properties, and this severely constrains the possibility of giant planet formation by direct gravitational instability.},

  abstract = {The issue of giant planet formation by core accretion (CA) far from the central star is rather controversial because the growth of a massive solid core necessary for triggering the gas runaway can take longer than the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk. In this work, we assess the range of separations at which CA may operate by (1) allowing for an arbitrary (physically meaningful) rate of planetesimal accretion by the core and (2) properly taking into account the dependence of the critical mass for the gas runaway on the planetesimal accretion luminosity. This self-consistent approach distinguishes our work from similar studies in which only a specific planetesimal accretion regime was explored and/or the critical core mass was fixed at some arbitrary level. We demonstrate that the largest separation at which the gas runaway can occur within 3 Myr corresponds to the surface density of solids in the disk 0.1 g cm-2 and is 40--50 AU in the minimum mass solar nebula. This limiting separation is achieved when the planetesimal accretion proceeds at the fastest possible rate, even though the high associated accretion luminosity increases the critical core mass, delaying the onset of gas runaway. Our constraints are independent of the mass of the central star and vary only weakly with the core density and its atmospheric opacity. We also discuss various factors that can strengthen or weaken our limits on the operation of CA.},

  abstract = {We explore the dynamics of small planetesimals coexisting with massive protoplanetary cores in a gaseous nebula. Gas drag strongly affects the motion of small bodies, leading to the decay of their eccentricities and inclinations, which are excited by the gravity of protoplanetary cores. Drag acting on larger (k1 km), highvelocity planetesimals causes a mere reduction of their average random velocity. By contrast, drag qualitatively changes the dynamics of smaller (P0.1--1 km), low-velocity objects: (1) small planetesimals sediment toward the midplane of the nebula, forming a vertically thin subdisk; (2) their random velocities rapidly decay between successive passages of the cores, and as a result, encounters with cores typically occur at the minimum relative velocity allowed by the shear in the disk. This leads to a drastic increase in the accretion rate of small planetesimals by the protoplanetary cores, allowing cores to grow faster than expected in the simple oligarchic picture, provided that the population of small planetesimals contains more than roughly 1\% of the solid mass in the nebula. Fragmentation of larger planetesimals (k1 km) in energetic collisions triggered by the gravitational scattering by cores can easily channel this amount of material into small bodies on reasonable timescales ({$<$}1 Myr in the outer solar system), providing a means for the rapid growth (within several million years at 30 AU ) of rather massive protoplanetary cores. Effects of inelastic collisions between planetesimals and presence of multiple protoplanetary cores are discussed.},

However, similar understanding of the chemistry of M and late-K dwarfs -- the most common stars in the Galaxy -- has been greatly hampered both observationally and theoretically by the complex molecular chemistry of their atmospheres. Here, we present a new implementation of the data-driven Cannon model, modelling Teff, log\,g, [Fe/H], and [Ti/Fe] trained on low--medium resolution optical spectra (4000--7000\,\,{\AA}) from 103 cool dwarf benchmarks. Alongside this, we also investigate the sensitivity of optical wavelengths to various atomic and molecular species using both data-driven and theoretical means via a custom grid of MARCS synthetic spectra, and make recommendations for where MARCS struggles to reproduce cool dwarf fluxes. Under leave-one-out cross-validation, our Cannon model is capable of recovering Teff, log\,g, [Fe/H], and [Ti/Fe] with precisions of 1.4 per~cent, \${\textbackslash}pm 0.04{\textbackslash},\$~dex, \${\textbackslash}pm 0.10{\textbackslash},\$~dex, and \${\textbackslash}pm 0.06{\textbackslash},\$~dex respectively, with the recovery of [Ti/Fe] pointing to the as-yet mostly untapped potential of exploiting the abundant -- but complex -- chemical information within optical spectra of cool stars.},

We aim to determine stellar parameters of M dwarfs using high resolution spectra (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\sim$} 90 000) simultaneously in the visible and the near-infrared.

Furthermore, this study will help in understanding the physical processes which occur in a cool atmospheres, particularly, the redistribution of energy from the optical to the near-infrared.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. The stellar parameters of M dwarfs in our sample have been determined by comparing the high resolution spectra both in the optical and in the near-infrared simultaneously observed by CARMENES with the synthetic spectra obtained from the BT-Settl model atmosphere. The detailed spectral synthesis of these observed spectra both in the optical and in the near-infrared helps to understand the missing continuum opacity.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}.

The study will allow us to further understand physical and chemical processes such as increasing condensation of gas into dust, to point out the missing continuum opacities, and to see how the main band features are reproduced by the models. The spectral resolution and the large wavelength coverage used is a unique combination that can constrain the processes that occur in a cool atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Methods. Equivalent widths of hundreds of weak photospheric lines were measured in the observed spectra of high quality and compared with those in synthetic spectra of appropriate models of stellar atmospheres. Results. The photospheric spectra of the three T Tauri stars are highly veiled. We found that the veiling is strongly line-dependent: larger in stronger photospheric lines and weak or absent in the weakest ones. No dependence of veiling on excitation potential within 0 to 5 eV was found. Different physical processes responsible for these unusual veiling effects are discussed in the framework of the magnetospheric accretion model. Conclusions. The observed veiling has two origins: (1) an abnormal structure of stellar atmosphere heated up by the accreting matter, and (2) a non-photospheric continuum radiated by a hot spot with temperature lower than 10 000 K. The true level of the veiling continuum can be derived by measuring the weakest photospheric lines with equivalent widths down to {$\approx$}10 m{\AA}. A limited spectral resolution and/or low signal-to-noise ratio results in overestimation of the veiling continuum. In the three very active stars, the veiling continuum is a minor contributor to the observed veiling, while the major contribution comes from the line-dependent veiling.},

  abstract = {The CARMENES radial velocity (RV) survey is observing 324 M dwarfs to search for any orbiting planets. In this paper, we present the survey sample by publishing one CARMENES spectrum for each M dwarf. These spectra cover the wavelength range 520--1710 nm at a resolution of at least R {$>$} 80 000, and we measure its RV, H{$\alpha$} emission, and projected rotation velocity. We present an atlas of high-resolution M-dwarf spectra and compare the spectra to atmospheric models. To quantify the RV precision that can be achieved in low-mass stars over the CARMENES wavelength range, we analyze our empirical information on the RV precision from more than 6500 observations. We compare our high-resolution M-dwarf spectra to atmospheric models where we determine the spectroscopic RV information content, Q, and signal-to-noise ratio. We find that for all M-type dwarfs, the highest RV precision can be reached in the wavelength range 700--900 nm. Observations at longer wavelengths are equally precise only at the very latest spectral types (M8 and M9). We demonstrate that in this spectroscopic range, the large amount of absorption features compensates for the intrinsic faintness of an M7 star. To reach an RV precision of 1 m s-1 in very low mass M dwarfs at longer wavelengths likely requires the use of a 10 m class telescope. For spectral types M6 and earlier, the combination of a red visual and a near-infrared spectrograph is ideal to search for low-mass planets and to distinguish between planets and stellar variability. At a 4 m class telescope, an instrument like CARMENES has the potential to push the RV precision well below the typical jitter level of 3--4 m s-1.},

Previous studies have shown that the detection of exoplanetary rings in transit light curves is possible, albeit challenging. To aid such future detection of exoplanetary rings, we present the Polygon~+~Segments model for modelling the light curve of an exoplanet with rings. This high-precision model includes full ring geometry as well as possible ring transparency and the host star's limb darkening. It is also computationally efficient, requiring just a 1D integration over a small range, making it faster than existing techniques. The algorithm at its core is further generalized to compute the light curve of any set of convex primitive shapes in transit (e.g. multiple planets, oblate planets, moons, rings, combination thereof, etc.) while accounting for their overlaps. The python source code is made available.},

Two processes affecting the surface composition have been taken into account, namely: (1) convective dredge-ups, and (2) nuclear burning in the deepest layers of the convective envelope. Mass loss due to the stellar wind in the red-giant phase, and the envelope ejection leading to the formation of planetary nebulae have been also taken into account. In this way, several individual and collective properties of carbon stars are predicted, as well as the expected compositions of planetary nebulae, and the contribution of intermediate-mass stars to the galactic nucleosynthesis of the nuclides listed above. The primary production of C-13 and N-14 is also treated. A preliminary comparison with the observations shows that the present theory is able to account for several characteristics of carbon stars in the Galaxy, as well as in the Magellanic Clouds, and in the dwarf elliptical galaxy in Fornax. The theory accounts also for the observed range of helium abundances in planetary nebulae.},

  abstract = {Context. The nearest stars provide a fundamental constraint for our understanding of stellar physics and the Galaxy. The nearby sample serves as an anchor where all objects can be seen and understood with precise data. This work is triggered by the most recent data release of the astrometric space mission Gaia and uses its unprecedented high precision parallax measurements to review the census of objects within 10 pc. Aims: The first aim of this work was to compile all stars and brown dwarfs within 10 pc observable by Gaia and compare it with the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars as a quality assurance test. We complement the list to get a full 10 pc census, including bright stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets. Methods: We started our compilation from a query on all objects with a parallax larger than 100 mas using the Set of Identifications, Measurements, and Bibliography for Astronomical Data database (SIMBAD). We completed the census by adding companions, brown dwarfs with recent parallax measurements not in SIMBAD yet, and vetted exoplanets. The compilation combines astrometry and photometry from the recent Gaia Early Data Release 3 with literature magnitudes, spectral types, and line-of-sight velocities. Results: We give a description of the astrophysical content of the 10 pc sample. We find a multiplicity frequency of around 27\%. Among the stars and brown dwarfs, we estimate that around 61\% are M stars and more than half of the M stars are within the range from M3.0 V to M5.0 V. We give an overview of the brown dwarfs and exoplanets that should be detected in the next Gaia data releases along with future developments. Conclusions: We provide a catalogue of 540 stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets in 339 systems, within 10 pc from the Sun. This list is as volume-complete as possible from current knowledge and it provides benchmark stars that can be used, for instance, to define calibration samples and to test the quality of the forthcoming Gaia releases. It also has a strong outreach potential.

We have used three different grain models to fit the 10 {$\mu$}m Si emission feature, and have found the results to be consistent with ISM-like dust. In comparison with other TWA members, this suggests lesser dust processing for 2M1207, which could be explained by mechanisms such as aggregate fragmentation and/or turbulent mixing. We have found a good fit using an inner disk radius equal to the dust sublimation radius, which indicates the absence of an inner hole in the disk.

We argue for the presence of a warm debris disk around 2M1139, based on an excess emission observed at 24 \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}m. The mid-infrared colors for 2M1139 are similar to the transition disks in the Taurus and Ophuichus regions.

  abstract = {Barnard's star is a red dwarf, and has the largest proper motion (apparent motion across the sky) of all known stars. At a distance of 1.8 parsecs1, it is the closest single star to the Sun; only the three stars in the {$\alpha$} Centauri system are closer. Barnard's star is also among the least magnetically active red dwarfs known2,3 and has an estimated age older than the Solar System. Its properties make it a prime target for planetary searches; various techniques with different sensitivity limits have been used previously, including radial-velocity imaging4--6, astrometry7,8 and direct imaging9, but all ultimately led to negative or null results. Here we combine numerous measurements from high-precision radial-velocity instruments, revealing the presence of a low-amplitude periodic signal with a period of 233 days. Independent photometric and spectroscopic monitoring, as well as an analysis of instrumental systematic effects, suggest that this signal is best explained as arising from a planetary companion. The candidate planet around Barnard's star is a cold super-Earth, with a minimum mass of 3.2 times that of Earth, orbiting near its snow line (the minimum distance from the star at which volatile compounds could condense). The combination of all radial-velocity datasets spanning 20 years of measurements additionally reveals a long-term modulation that could arise from a stellar magnetic-activity cycle or from a more distant planetary object. Because of its proximity to the Sun, the candidate planet has a maximum angular separation of 220 milliarcseconds from Barnard's star, making it an excellent target for direct imaging and astrometric observations in the future.},

  abstract = {Methods. The CARMENES survey target selection was aimed at minimising biases, and about 70\% of all known M dwarfs within 10 pc and accessible from Calar Alto were included. The data were pipeline-processed, and high-level data products, including 18 642 precise RVs for 345 targets, were derived. Time series data of spectroscopic activity indicators were also obtained. Results. We discuss the characteristics of the CARMENES data, the statistical properties of the stellar sample, and the spectroscopic measurements. We show examples of the use of CARMENES data and provide a contextual view of the exoplanet population revealed by the survey, including 33 new planets, 17 re-analysed planets, and 26 confirmed planets from transiting candidate follow-up. A subsample of 238 targets was used to derive updated planet occurrence rates, yielding an overall average of 1.44 {\textpm} 0.20 planets with 1 M{$\oplus$} {$<$} Mpl sin i {$<$} 1000 M{$\oplus$} and 1 day {$<$} Porb {$<$} 1000 days per star, and indicating that nearly every M dwarf hosts at least one planet. All the DR1 raw data, pipeline-processed data, and high-level data products are publicly available online. Conclusions. CARMENES data have proven very useful for identifying and measuring planetary companions. They are also suitable for a variety of additional applications, such as the determination of stellar fundamental and atmospheric properties, the characterisation of stellar activity, and the study of exoplanet atmospheres.},

We detect emission from dust continuum at 0.89 mm and from the rotational transition of CO from a very compact disk around the young brown dwarf. The small radius found for this brown dwarf disk may be due to truncation from the tidal interaction with the planetary-mass companion. Under the assumption of optically thin dust emission, we estimate a dust mass of 0.1 M{$\oplus$} for the 2M1207A disk and a 3{$\sigma$} upper limit of {$\sim$}1 MMoon for dust surrounding 2M1207b, which is the tightest upper limit obtained so far for the mass of dust particles surrounding a young planetary-mass companion. We discuss the impact of this and other non-detections of young planetary-mass companions for models of planet formation that predict circumplanetary material to surround these objects.},

  abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will search for planets transiting bright and nearby stars. TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its two-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical CCD cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I = 4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every four months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

We summarize the performance of the spacecraft, telescope, science instruments, and ground system, with an emphasis on differences from pre-launch expectations. Commissioning has made clear that JWST is fully capable of achieving the discoveries for which it was built. Moreover, almost across the board, the science performance of JWST is better than expected; in most cases, JWST will go deeper faster than expected. The telescope and instrument suite have demonstrated the sensitivity, stability, image quality, and spectral range that are necessary to transform our understanding of the cosmos through observations spanning from near-earth asteroids to the most distant galaxies.},

Moreover, almost across the board, the science performance of JWST is better than expected; in most cases, JWST will go deeper faster than expected. The telescope and instrument suite have demonstrated the sensitivity, stability, image quality, and spectral range that are necessary to transform our understanding of the cosmos through observations spanning from near-earth asteroids to the most distant galaxies.},

From these spectra, we measure equivalent widths of the Ca and Na lines, and a spectral index quantifying the absorption due to H2O opacity (the H2O--K2 index). Using empirical spectral type standards and synthetic models, we calibrate the H2O--K2 index as an indicator of an M dwarf's spectral type and effective temperature. We also present a revised relationship that estimates the [Fe/H] and [M/H] metallicities of M dwarfs from their Na i, Ca i, and H2O--K2 measurements. Comparisons to model atmosphere provide a qualitative validation of our approach, but also reveal an overall offset between the atomic line strengths predicted by models as compared to actual observations. Our metallicity estimates also reproduce expected correlations with Galactic space motions and H{$\alpha$} emission line strengths, and return statistically identical metallicities for M dwarfs within a common multiple system. Finally, we find systematic residuals between our H2O-based spectral types and those derived from optical spectral features with previously known sensitivity to stellar metallicity, such as TiO, and identify the CaH1 index as a promising optical index for diagnosing the metallicities of near-solar M dwarfs.},

They are observed in all kinds of astrophysical environments, from the smallest to the largest scales, and are at the basis of all known forms of life, hence, the constituents of any biomarker. As such, their study proves crucial in several areas of contemporary astrophysics, extending to astrobiology. In this review, I will summarize current knowledge about CNO element evolution in galaxies, starting from our home, the Milky Way. After a brief recap of CNO synthesis in stars, I will present the comparison between chemical evolution model predictions and observations of CNO isotopic abundances and abundance ratios in stars and in the gaseous matter. Such a comparison permits to constrain the modes and time scales of the assembly of galaxies and their stellar populations, as well as stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis theories. I will stress that chemical evolution models must be carefully calibrated against the wealth of abundance data available for the Milky Way before they can be applied to the interpretation of observational datasets for other systems. In this vein, I will also discuss the usefulness of some key CNO isotopic ratios as probes of the prevailing, galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function in galaxies where more direct estimates from the starlight are unfeasible.},

  abstract = {We use state-of-the-art chemical models to track the cosmic evolution of the CNO isotopes in the interstellar medium of galaxies, yielding powerful constraints on their stellar initial mass function (IMF). We re-assess the relative roles of massive stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and novae in the production of rare isotopes such as 13C, 15N, 17O and 18O, along with 12C, 14N and 16O. The CNO isotope yields of super-AGB stars, novae and fast-rotating massive stars are included. Having reproduced the available isotope enrichment data in the solar neighbourhood, and across the Galaxy, and having assessed the sensitivity of our models to the remaining uncertainties, e.g. nova yields and star formation history, we show that we can meaningfully constrain the stellar IMF in galaxies using C, O and N isotope abundance ratios. In starburst galaxies, where data for multiple isotopologue lines are available, we find compelling new evidence for a top-heavy stellar IMF, with profound implications for their star formation rates and efficiencies, perhaps also their stellar masses. Neither chemical fractionation nor selective photodissociation can significantly perturb globally averaged isotopologue abundance ratios away from the corresponding isotope ones, as both these processes will typically affect only small mass fractions of molecular clouds in galaxies. Thus, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array now stands ready to probe the stellar IMF, and even the ages of specific starburst events in star-forming galaxies across cosmic time unaffected by the dust obscuration effects that plague optical/near-infrared studies.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} After more than 50 years, astronomical research still struggles to reconstruct the history of lithium enrichment in the Galaxy and to establish the relative importance of the various \textsuperscript{7{$<$}sup/{$>$}Li sources in enriching the interstellar medium (ISM) with this fragile element.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} To better trace the evolution of lithium in the Milky Way discs, we exploit the unique characteristics of a sample of open clusters (OCs) and field stars for which high-precision \textsuperscript{7{$<$}sup/{$>$}Li abundances and stellar parameters are homogeneously derived by the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}-ESO Survey (GES).\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We derive possibly un-depleted \textsuperscript{7{$<$}sup/{$>$}Li abundances for 26 OCs and star forming regions with ages from young ({$\sim$}3 Myr) to old ({$\sim$}4.5 Gyr), spanning a large range of galactocentric distances, 5 {$<$} \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{GC{$<$}sub/{$>$}/kpc {$<$} 15, which allows us to reconstruct the local late Galactic evolution of lithium as well as its current abundance gradient along the disc. Field stars are added to look further back in time and to constrain \textsuperscript{7{$<$}sup/{$>$}Li evolution in other Galactic components. The data are then compared to theoretical tracks from chemical evolution models that implement different \textsuperscript{7{$<$}sup/{$>$}Li forges.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Thanks to the homogeneity of the GES analysis, we can combine the maximum average \textsuperscript{7{$<$}sup/{$>$}Li abundances derived for the clusters with \textsuperscript{7{$<$}sup/{$>$}Li measurements in field stars. We find that the upper envelope of the \textsuperscript{7{$<$}sup/{$>$}Li abundances measured in field stars of nearly solar metallicities (-0.3 {$<$} [Fe/H]/dex {$<$} +0.3) traces very well the level of lithium enrichment attained by the ISM as inferred from observations of cluster stars in the same metallicity range. We confirm previous findings that the abundance of \textsuperscript{7{$<$}sup/{$>$}Li in the solar neighbourhood does not decrease at super-solar metallicity. The comparison of the data with the chemical evolution model predictions favours a scenario in which the majority of the \textsuperscript{7{$<$}sup/{$>$}Li abundance in meteorites comes from novae. Current data also seem to suggest that the nova rate flattens out at later times. This requirement might have implications for the masses of the white dwarf nova progenitors and deserves further investigation. Neutrino-induced reactions taking place in core-collapse supernovae also produce some fresh lithium. This likely makes a negligible contribution to the meteoritic abundance, but could be responsible for a mild increase in the \textsuperscript{7{$<$}sup/{$>$}Li abundance in the ISM of low-metallicity systems that would counterbalance the astration processes.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Stellar lifetimes and initial mass function are basic ingredients of chemical evolution models, for which different recipes can be found in the literature. In this paper, we quantify the effects on chemical evolution studies of the uncertainties in these two parameters. We concentrate on chemical evolution models for the Milky Way, because of the large number of good observational constraints. Such chemical evolution models have already ruled out significant temporal variations for the stellar initial mass function in our own Galaxy, with the exception perhaps of the very early phases of its evolution. Therefore, here we assume a Galactic initial mass function constant in time. Through an accurate comparison of model predictions for the Milky Way with carefully selected data sets, it is shown that specific prescriptions for the initial mass function in particular mass ranges should be rejected. As far as the stellar lifetimes are concerned, the major differences among existing prescriptions are found in the range of very low-mass stars. Because of this, the model predictions differ widely for those elements which are produced mostly by very long-lived objects, as for instance 3He and 7Li. However, we conclude that model predictions of several important observed quantities, constraining the plausible Galactic formation scenarios, are fairly robust with respect to changes in both the stellar mass spectrum and lifetimes. For instance, the metallicity distribution of low-mass stars is nearly unaffected by these changes, since its shape is dictated mostly by the time scale for thin-disk formation.},

  abstract = {The trends of chemical abundances and abundance ratios observed in stars of different ages, kinematics, and metallicities bear the imprints of several physical processes which concur, thus shaping the host galaxy properties. By inspecting these trends, we obtain precious information on stellar nucleosynthesis, the stellar mass spectrum, the timescale of structure formation, the efficiency of star formation, as well as any inward or outward flows of gas. In this paper, we analyse recent determinations of carbon-to-iron and carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratios in different environments (the Milky Way and elliptical galaxies), using our latest chemical evolution models that implement up-to-date stellar yields and rely on the tight constraints provided by asteroseismic stellar ages, whenever available. A scenario where most carbon is produced by rotating massive stars, with yields largely dependent on the metallicity of the parent proto-star clouds, allowed us to simultaneously fit the high-quality data available for the local Galactic components (thick and thin discs) and for microlensed dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge, as well as the abundance ratios inferred for massive elliptical galaxies. Nevertheless, more efforts are needed from both observers and theoreticians in order to base these conclusions on firmer ground.},

  abstract = {Context. The recent detection of super-solar carbon-to-oxygen and nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in a group of metal-poor galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope has sparked renewed interest in exploring the chemical evolution of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (the CNO elements) at early times and prompted fresh inquiries into their origins. Aims. The main goal of this paper is to shed light onto the early evolution of the main CNO isotopes in the Galaxy and in young distant systems, such as GN-z11 at ɀ = 10.6 and GS-zl2 at ɀ = 12.5. Methods. To this aim, we incorporated a stochastic star formation component into a chemical evolution model calibrated with high-quality Milky Way (MW) data while focusing on the contribution of Population III (Pop III) stars to the early chemical enrichment. Results. By comparing the model predictions with CNO abundance measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy of an homogeneous sample of Galactic halo stars, we first demonstrate that the scatter observed in the metallicity range -4.5 {$\leq$} [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -1.5 can be explained by pre-enrichment from Pop III stars that explode as supernovae (SNe) with different initial masses and energies. Then, by exploiting the chemical evolution model, we provide testable predictions for log(C/N), log(N/O), and log(C/O) versus log(O/H)+12 in MW-like galaxies observed at different cosmic epochs (redshifts). Finally, by calibrating the chemical evolution model to replicate the observed properties of GN-z11 and GS-z12, we provide an alternative interpretation of their high N/O and C/O abundance ratios, demonstrating that an anomalously high N or C content can be reproduced through enrichment from faint Pop III SNe. Conclusions. Stochastic chemical enrichment from primordial stars explains both the observed scatter in CNO abundances in MW halo stars and the exceptionally high C/O and N/O ratios in some distant galaxies. These findings emphasize the critical role of Pop III stars in shaping early chemical evolution.},

We can therefore use their atmospheres as proxies for planetary atmospheres, testing our understanding of physics and chemistry for these complex, cool worlds. At these cold temperatures, their atmospheres are cold enough for water clouds to form, and chemical timescales increase, increasing the likelihood of disequilibrium chemistry compared to warmer classes of planets. JWST observations are revolutionizing the characterization of these worlds with high signal-to-noise, moderate resolution near- and mid-infrared spectra. The spectra have been used to measure the abundances of prominent species like water, methane, and ammonia; species that trace chemical reactions like carbon monoxide; and even isotopologues of carbon monoxide and ammonia. Here, we present atmospheric retrieval results using both published fixed-slit (GTO program 1230) and new averaged time series observations (GO program 2327) of the coldest known Y dwarf, WISE 0855-0714 (using NIRSpec G395M spectra), which has an effective temperature of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 264 K. We present a detection of deuterium in an atmosphere outside of the solar system via a relative measurement of deuterated methane (CH\$\_\{3\}\$D) and standard methane. From this, we infer the D/H ratio of a substellar object outside the solar system for the first time. We also present a well-constrained part-per-billion abundance of phosphine (PH\$\_\{3\}\$). We discuss our interpretation of these results and the implications for brown dwarf and giant exoplanet formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {Constraining L dwarf properties from their spectra is challenging. Near-infrared (NIR) spectra probe a limited range of pressures, while many species condense within their photospheres. Condensation creates two complexities: gas-phase species "rain out" (decreasing in abundances by many orders of magnitude) and clouds form. We designed tests using synthetic data to determine the best approach for retrieving L dwarf spectra, isolating the challenges in the absence of cloud opacity. We conducted atmospheric retrievals on synthetic cloud-free L dwarf spectra derived from the Sonora Bobcat models at SpeX resolution using a variety of thermal and chemical abundance profile parameterizations. For objects hotter than L5 (T eff {\textasciitilde} 1700 K), the limited pressure layers probed in the NIR are mostly convective; parameterized pressure-temperature (PT) profiles bias results and free, unsmoothed profiles should be used. Only when many layers both above and below the radiative-convective boundary are probed can parameterized profiles provide accurate results. Furthermore, a nonuniform abundance profile for FeH is needed to accurately retrieve bulk properties of early-to-mid L dwarfs. Nonuniform prescriptions for other gases in NIR retrievals may also be warranted near the L/T transition (CH4) and early Y dwarfs (Na and K). We demonstrate the utility of using realistic, self-consistent models to benchmark retrievals and suggest how they can be used in the future.},

In this work, we present the first NIRSpec IFU high-contrast observations of a substellar companion that requires starlight suppression techniques. We develop specific data reduction strategies to study faint companions around bright stars, and assess the performance of NIRSpec at high contrast. First, we demonstrate an approach to forward model the companion signal and the starlight directly in the detector images, which mitigates the effects of NIRSpec's spatial undersampling. We demonstrate a sensitivity to planets that are 3e-6 fainter than their stars at 1'', or 3e-5 at 0.3''. Then, we implement a reference star point spread function (PSF) subtraction and a spectral extraction that does not require spatially and spectrally regularly sampled spectral cubes. This allows us to extract a moderate resolution (R{\textasciitilde}2,700) spectrum of the faint T-dwarf companion HD 19467 B from 2.9-5.2 um with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N){\textasciitilde}10 per resolution element. Across this wavelength range, HD{\textasciitilde}19467{\textasciitilde}B has a flux ratio varying between 1e-5-1e-4 and a separation relative to its star of 1.6''. A companion paper by Hoch et al. more deeply analyzes the atmospheric properties of this companion based on the extracted spectrum. Using the methods developed here, NIRSpec's sensitivity may enable direct detection and spectral characterization of relatively old ({\textasciitilde}1 Gyr), cool ({\textasciitilde}250 K), and closely separated ({\textasciitilde}3-5 au) exoplanets that are less massive than Jupiter.},

These RV measurements help to constrain the 3D orientation of the orbit of the planet by resolving the degeneracy in the longitude of an ascending node. Assuming coplanar orbits for HR 8799 b and c, but not including d and e, we estimate W = 89 -+1277 and i = 20. 8 -+34..75.},

Here we report a broad-wavelength 0.5--5.5\,{\textmu}m atmospheric transmission spectrum of WASP-39b               8               , a 1,200\,K, roughly Saturn-mass, Jupiter-radius exoplanet, measured with the JWST NIRSpec's PRISM mode               9               as part of the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Team Program               10--12               .

  abstract = {We present predictions for the surface density of ultracool dwarfs (with spectral types M8-T8) for a host of deep fields that are likely to be observed with the James Webb Space Telescope. Based on simple thin and thick/thin disk (exponential) models, we show that the typical distance modulus is {$\mu$} {$\approx$} 9.8 mag, which at high Galactic latitude is 5\{log\}(2 \{z\}\{scl\})-5. Since this is a property of the density distribution of an exponential disk, it is independent of spectral type or stellar sample. Using the published estimates of the ultracool dwarf luminosity function, we show that their number counts typically peak around J{$\sim$} 24 mag with a total surface density of \{\{{$\Sigma$} \}\}{$\sim$} 0.3 arcmin-2, but with a strong dependence on galactic coordinate and spectral type. Owing to the exponential shape of the disk, the ultracool dwarfs are very rare at faint magnitudes (J{$\geq$}slant 27 mag), with typical densities of \{\{{$\Sigma$} \}\}{$\sim$} 0.005 arcmin-2 (or {$\sim$} 20\% of the total contribution within the field). Therefore, in very narrow and deep fields, we predict there are only a few ultracool dwarfs, and hence these stars are likely not a severe contaminant in searches for high-redshift galaxies. Furthermore, the ultracool dwarfs are expected to be considerably brighter than the high-redshift galaxies, so samples near the faint end of the high-redshift galaxy population will be the purest. We present the star-count formalism in a simplified way so that observers may easily predict the number of stars for their conditions (field, depth, wavelength, etc.).},

The heat flux, viscosity, and thermal diffusivity are assumed to be small enough to that, away from the interface between the phases, the flux is mainly carried by turbulent convection with a very small superadiabaticity. Different modes are investigated for transporting the heat flux across the interface, and both possible signs of the latent heat L are considered. A thermal boundary layer, distortion of the interface, and the nucleation, growth and motion of droplets and bubbles are included. It is shown that, under a specified range of conditions, the transition region near the interface is thin with a small change in the temperature T across it. The entropy difference between the two phases is then L/T. These considerations probably apply to the interior of Jupiter.},

Formation models make specific predictions on the atmospheric abundances of Carbon (C) and Oxygen (O) in companion atmospheres relative to their host stars that are dependent on formation via core accretion in a disk or gravitational collapse in a cloud core. Using sensitive Wield Field Camera 3 grism observations, we obtained spatially resolved spectra for WISE1217+1626 and WISE1711+3500, two directly imaged brown dwarf - brown dwarf binaries with late T to early Y spectral classification types, for each component. The effective temperatures of these ultra-cool objects make them amenable to atmospheric retrievals which provide the means to measure the abundances of the dominant Carbon and Oxygen bearing species in these substellar atmospheres. Using these measured abundances we calculate C/O and metallicity for each component, making this study a benchmark comparison for the atmospheres of both directly imaged and transiting exoplanet systems. Measuring these quantities for each component enables a test of whether brown dwarf companions form more akin to stellar binaries or like planets in a disk. By studying brown dwarfs in a binary pair, we are able to apply the same modeling and retrieval scheme for each component of the pair, unlike similar analysis with star-planet systems. We will present the initial comparison of the C/O and metallicity for each component in these benchmark systems.},

Emission is detected in five out of the nine BD disks. Dust disk mass, brightness profiles, and characteristic sizes of the BD population are inferred from continuum flux and modeling of the observations. Only one source is marginally resolved, allowing for the determination of its disk characteristic size. We conduct a demographic comparison between the properties of disks around BDs and stars in Lupus. Due to the small sample size, we cannot confirm or disprove a drop in the disk mass over stellar mass ratio for BDs, as suggested for Ophiuchus. Nevertheless, we find that all detected BD disks have an estimated dust mass between 0.2 and 3.2 M ; these results suggest that the measured solid masses in BD disks cannot explain the observed exoplanet population, analogous to earlier findings on disks around more massive stars. Combined with the low estimated accretion rates, and assuming that the mm-continuum emission is a reliable proxy for the total disk mass, we derive ratios of M˙ acc/Mdisk that are significantly lower than in disks around more massive stars. If confirmed with more accurate measurements of disk gas masses, this result could imply a qualitatively different relationship between disk masses and inward gas transport in BD disks.},

  abstract = {The JWST has ushered in a new era of exoplanet transit spectroscopy. Among the JWST instruments, the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) has the most extensive set of configurations for exoplanet time series observations. The NIRSpec Prism and G395H grating represent two extremes in NIRSpec instrument modes, with the Prism spanning a wider spectral range (0.6-5.3 {\textmu}m) at lower resolution (R{$\sim$}100) compared to G395H (2.87-5.14 {\textmu}m; R{$\sim$}2700). In this work, we develop a new data reduction framework, JexoPipe, to conduct a homogeneous assessment of the two NIRSpec modes for exoplanet spectroscopy. We use observations of the hot Saturn WASP-39 b obtained as part of the JWST Transiting Exoplanets ERS program to assess the spectral quality and stability between the two instrument modes at different epochs. We explore the noise sources, effect of saturation, and offsets in transmission spectra between the different instrument modes and also between the two G395H NRS detectors. We find an inter-detector offset in G395H of {$\sim$} 40-50 ppm, consistent with recent studies. We find evidence for correlated noise in the Prism white light curve. We find the G395H spectrum to be of higher precision compared to the Prism at the same resolution. We also compare the JexoPipe spectra with those reported from other pipelines. Our work underscores the need for robust assessment of instrument performance and identification of optimal practices for JWST data reduction and analyses.},

  abstract = {The stability of planetary orbits around the GJ 832 star system, which contains inner (GJ 832c) and outer (GJ 832b) planets, is investigated numerically and a detailed phase-space analysis is performed. Special attention is given to the existence of stable orbits for a planet less than 15 M{$\oplus$} that is injected between the inner and outer planets. Thus, numerical simulations are performed for three and four bodies in elliptical orbits (or circular for special cases) by using a large number of initial conditions that cover the selected phase-spaces of the planet's orbital parameters. The results presented in the phase-space maps for GJ 832c indicate the least deviation of eccentricity from its nominal value, which is then used to determine its inclination regime relative to the star--outer planet plane. Also, the injected planet is found to display stable orbital configurations for at least one billion years. Then, the radial velocity curves based on the signature from the Keplerian motion are generated for the injected planets with masses 1 M{$\oplus$} to 15 M{$\oplus$} in order to estimate their semimajor axes and mass limits. The synthetic RV signal suggests that an additional planet of mass {$\leq$}15 M{$\oplus$} with a dynamically stable configuration may be residing between 0.25 and 2.0 au from the star. We have provided an estimated number of RV observations for the additional planet that is required for further observational verification.},

Previous studies suggest that the density gradient of this system could be due to the growth of planets from icy planetesimals that progressively lost their volatile content during their inward drift through the protoplanetary disk. Here we investigate the alternative possibility that the planets formed in a dry protoplanetary disk populated with pebbles made of phyllosilicates, a class of hydrated minerals with a water fraction possibly exceeding 10 wt\%. We show that the dehydration of these minerals in the inner regions of the disk and the outward diffusion of the released vapor up to the ice-line location allow the condensation of ice onto grains. Pebbles with water mass fractions consistent with those of planets d--h would have formed at the snow-line location. In contrast, planets b and c would have been accreted from drier material in regions closer to the star than the phyllosilicate dehydration line.},

It is through these giant impacts that planets like the young Earth grow to their final mass and achieve long-term stable orbital configurations1. A key prediction is that these impacts produce debris. So far, the most compelling observational evidence for post-impact debris comes from the planetary system around the nearby 23-million-year-old A-type star HD\,172555. This system shows large amounts of fine dust with an unusually steep size distribution and atypical dust composition, previously attributed to either a hypervelocity impact2,3 or a massive asteroid belt4. Here we report the spectrally resolved detection of a carbon monoxide gas ring co-orbiting with dusty debris around HD\,172555 between about six and nine astronomical units---a region analogous to the outer terrestrial planet region of our Solar System. Taken together, the dust and carbon monoxide detections favour a giant impact between large, volatile-rich bodies. This suggests that planetary-scale collisions, analogous to the Moon-forming impact, can release large amounts of gas as well as debris, and that this gas is observable, providing a window into the composition of young planets.},

This new object, SSSPM J1102-3431, has extremely red optical, optical-to-infrared, and near-infrared colours (, , ), while low-resolution not only classifies it as a late-type (M8.5) object, but also shows spectral signatures of low gravity as expected for a young brown dwarf.

SSSPM J1102-3431 lies only {\textasciitilde}12 arcmin away from the T Tauri star TW Hya and their proper motions agree to within the errors, and thus it is possible that the two objects form an extremely wide binary system, with a separation of {\textasciitilde}40 000 AU at pc. We have also obtained improved proper motions for SSS 120727.4-324700 and SSS 101726.7-535428, recent additions to the list of TWA members (Song et al. [CITE]). The relatively large proper motion of the latter object is consistent with the suggested proximity ( pc) of this lowest-mass stellar representative of the TWA.}}},

  abstract = {Aims: We determine the radii and masses of 293 nearby, bright M dwarfs of the CARMENES survey. This is the first time that such a large and homogeneous high-resolution (R {$>$} 80 000) spectroscopic survey has been used to derive these fundamental stellar parameters. Methods: We derived the radii using Stefan-Boltzmann's law. We obtained the required effective temperatures Teff from a spectral analysis and we obtained the required luminosities L from integrated broadband photometry together with the Gaia DR2 parallaxes. The mass was then determined using a mass-radius relation that we derived from eclipsing binaries known in the literature. We compared this method with three other methods: (1) We calculated the mass from the radius and the surface gravity log g, which was obtained from the same spectral analysis as Teff. (2) We used a widely used infrared mass-magnitude relation. (3) We used a Bayesian approach to infer stellar parameters from the comparison of the absolute magnitudes and colors of our targets with evolutionary models. Results: Between spectral types M0 V and M7 V our radii cover the range 0.1 R{$\odot$} {$<$} R {$<$} 0.6 R{$\odot$} with an error of 2-3\% and our masses cover 0.09 {$M\odot$} {$<$} {$M<$} 0.6{$M\odot$} with an error of 3-5\%. We find good agreement between the masses determined with these different methods for most of our targets. Only the masses of very young objects show discrepancies. This can be well explained with the assumptions that we used for our methods.

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Open clusters are ideal tools for tracing the abundances of different elements because their stars are expected to have the same age, distance, and metallicity. Therefore, they serve as powerful tracers for investigating the cosmic origins of elements. This paper expands on a recent study by us, in which the element fluorine was studied in seven open clusters; here we add six open clusters and eight field stars.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} The primary objective is to determine the abundance of fluorine (F) to gain insight into its production and evolution. The magnesium (Mg) abundances were derived to categorize the field stars into high and low alpha disk populations. Additionally, cerium (Ce) abundances were determined to better understand the interplay between F and \emph{s{$<$}i/{$>$}-process elements. Our goal is to analyze the trend of F abundances across the Galactic disk based on metallicity and age. By comparing observational data with Galactic chemical evolution models, the origin of F can be better understood.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The spectra were obtained from the high-resolution near-infrared GIANO-B instrument at the Telescopio Nazionale \emph{Galileo{$<$}i/{$>$} (TNG). For the derivation of the stellar parameters and abundances, the Python version of Spectroscopy Made Easy (PySME) was used. OH, CN, and CO molecular lines and band heads along with Fe I lines were used to determine the stellar parameters in the \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}-band region. Two HF lines in the \emph{K{$<$}i/{$>$} band (\emph{{$\lambda\lambda<$}i/{$>$} 2.28, and 2.33 {$\mu$}m), three \emph{K{$<$}i/{$>$}-band Mg I lines (\emph{{$\lambda\lambda<$}i/{$>$} 2.10, 2.11, and 2.15 {$\mu$}m), and two Ce II lines in the \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$} band (\emph{{$\lambda\lambda<$}i/{$>$} 1.66, and 1.71 {$\mu$}m) were used to derive the abundances of F, Mg, and Ce, respectively.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} F, Mg, and Ce abundances were derived for 14 stars from 6 OCs, as well as for 8 field stars. The F and Ce abundances were investigated as a function of metallicity, age, and galactocentric distance. We also compared our findings with different Galactic chemical evolution models.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our results indicate that asymptotic giant branch stars and massive stars, including a subset of fast rotators (whose rotation speed likely increases as metallicity decreases), are necessary to explain the cosmic origin of F. This finding is consistent with and, with the large sample size, reinforces the conclusion of our previous study.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

Using our SED fitting pipeline, we determine a photospheric model for each star and determine its significance of excess (SOE) inWISE passbands W3 and W4, which is used to classify potential IR excess. Through exhaustive vetting procedures, we present 37 new late-type IR-excess candidates, most of them M dwarfs, along with analyses of 12 previously known IR-excess stars. We group our candidates into two categories based on their SOE and likelihood of contamination. We also perform an isochronal age analysis as well as a moving group membership analysis, and discover six potential moving group members belonging to {$\beta$} Pictoris, Argus, Carina, Columba, and Tucana/Horologium Moving Groups. We conclude with a discussion of the nature of IR excess around late-type stars.},

Accurate electron temperatures in 67 H II regions spanning the range RG = 3.5-13.7 kpc were determined using radio recombination lines and these temperatures were applied to optical spectra of 33 of the same H II regions in order to determine the abundances of O, N, S, Ne, Ar, and He(+). Among other results, it is found that some H II regions have electron temperatures below 5000 K and that the radio-determined electron temperatures agree well with those obtained from the optical line ratios, in the light of standard models of H II regions. A gradient of H II region electron temperature with distance from the galactic center is found which equals +433 + or - 40 K/kpc, while the oxygen abundance gradient is -0.07 + or - 0.015 dex/kpc. The nitrogen abundance gradient is similar to that of oxygen, -0.09 + or 0.015 dex/kpc, while the sulfur abundance gradient (-0.01 + or - 0.02 dex/kpc) is significantly flatter than that of oxygen. No significant gradient in He(+)/H(+) is detected. In addition, evidence indicates that the abundance gradients may be steeper over the inner regions of the galactic disk.},

  abstract = {Giant planets around young stars serve as a clue to unveiling their formation history and orbital evolution. CI Tau is a 2 Myr-old classical T Tauri star hosting an eccentric hot Jupiter, CI Tau b. The standard formation scenario of a hot Jupiter predicts that planets formed further out and migrated inward. A high eccentricity of CI Tau b may be suggestive of high-e migration due to secular gravitational perturbations by an outer companion. Also, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.3 mm-continuum observations show that CI Tau has at least three annular gaps in which unseen planets may exist. We present high-contrast imaging around CI Tau taken from the Keck/NIRC2 -band filter and vortex coronagraph that allows us to search for an outer companion. We did not detect any outer companion around CI Tau from angular differential imaging (ADI) using two deep imaging data sets. The detection limits from ADI-reduced images rule out the existence of an outer companion beyond {$\sim$}30 au that can cause the Kozai--Lidov migration of CI Tau b. Our results suggest that CI Tau b may have experienced type II migration from {$\lessequivlnt$}2 au in megayears. We also confirm that no planets with {$\geq$}2--4 M Jup are hidden in two outer gaps.},

  abstract = {Methods. We present simulations of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT, both probing thermal emission from a planet at infrared wavelengths, and starlight reflected off a planet atmosphere at optical wavelengths. For the infrared simulations we use the baseline parameters of the E-ELT and METIS instrument, with the latter combining extreme adaptive optics with an R = 100 000 IFS. We include realistic models of the adaptive optics performance and atmospheric transmission and emission. For the optical simulation we also assume R = 100 000 IFS with adaptive optics capabilities at the E-ELT. Results. One night of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT at 4.8 {$\mu$}m ({$\Delta\lambda$} = 0.07 {$\mu$}m) can detect a planet orbiting {$\alpha$} Cen A with a radius of R = 1.5 Rearth and a twin-Earth thermal spectrum of Teq = 300 K at a signal-to-noise (S/N) of 5. In the optical, with a Strehl ratio performance of 0.3, reflected light from an Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri can be detected at a S/N of 10 in the same time frame. Recently, first HDS+HCI observations have shown the potential of this technique by determining the spin-rotation of the young massive exoplanet {$\beta$} Pictoris b. Conclusions. The exploration of the planetary systems of our neighbor stars is of great scientific and philosophical value. The HDS+HCI technique has the potential to detect and characterize temperate rocky planets in their habitable zones. Exoplanet scientists should not shy away from claiming a significant fraction of the future ELTs to make such observations possible.},

This eliminated most of the candidates more distant than 100 pc. Three Tycho stars, almost certainly members of the Lower Centaurus Crux association, are the most distant members of the TWA. A claim of isotropic expansion of TWA has to be re-evaluated based on our new results. Generally, one cannot identify new members of a diffuse nearby stellar group based solely on kinematic data.

  abstract = {Methods. We used a sample of 14 accreting stars observed with the CFHT/SPIRou spectrograph, within the framework of the SPIRou Legacy Survey, to measure the NIR veiling along the Y JHK bands. We compared the veiling measurements with accretion and inner disk diagnostics. We also analyzed circumstellar emission lines and photometric observations from the literature. Results. The measured veiling grows from the Y to the K band for most of the targets in our sample. The IR veiling agrees with NIR emission excess obtained using photometric data. However, we also find a linear correlation between the veiling and the accretion properties of the system, showing that accretion contributes to the inner disk heating and, consequently, to the inner disk emission excess. We also show a connection between the NIR veiling and the system's inclination with respect to our line of sight. This is probably due to the reduction of the visible part of the inner disk edge, where the NIR emission excess is expected to arise, as the inclination of the system increases. Our search for periods on the veiling variability showed that the IR veiling is not clearly periodic in the typical timescale of stellar rotation -- which, again, is broadly consistent with the idea that the veiling comes from the inner disk region. The NIR veiling appears variable on a timescale of a day, showing the night-by-night dynamics of the optical veiling variability. In the long term, the mean NIR veiling seems to be stable for most of the targets on timescales of a month to a few years. However, during occasional episodes of high accretion in classical T Tauri stars, which affect the system's dynamic, the veiling also seems to be much more prominent at such times, as we found in the case of the target RU Lup. Conclusions. We provide further evidence that for most targets in our sample, the veiling that mainly occurs in the JHK bands arises from dust in the inner disk.},

The quantitative analysis included synthetic spectra computed with 1D LTE plane-parallel MARCS models using the APOGEE Data Release 17 line list to determine chemical abundances. The sample consists of 11 M dwarfs in binary systems with warmer FGK dwarf primaries and 10 measured interferometric angular diameters. To minimize atomic diffusion effects, [X/Fe] ratios are used to compare M dwarfs in binary systems and literature results for their warmer primary stars, indicating good agreement ({$<$}0.08 dex) for all studied elements. The mean abundance difference in primaries minus this work's M dwarfs is -0.05 {\textpm} 0.03 dex. It indicates that M dwarfs in binary systems are a reliable way to calibrate empirical relationships. A comparison with abundance, effective temperature, and surface gravity results from the APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) Data Release 16 finds a systematic offset of [M/H], T eff, log g = +0.21 dex, -50 K, and 0.30 dex, respectively, although ASPCAP [X/Fe] ratios are generally consistent with this study. The metallicities of the M dwarfs cover the range of [Fe/H] = -0.9 to +0.4 and are used to investigate Galactic chemical evolution via trends of [X/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H]. The behavior of the various elemental abundances [X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] agrees well with the corresponding trends derived from warmer FGK dwarfs, demonstrating that the APOGEE spectra can be used to examine Galactic chemical evolution using large samples of selected M dwarfs.},

  abstract = {Gas-giant planets that form via core accretion might have very different characteristics from those that form via disk instability. Disk-instability objects are typically thought to have higher entropies, larger radii, and (generally) higher effective temperatures than core-accretion objects. In this paper, we provide a large set of models exploring the observational consequences of high-entropy (hot) and low-entropy (cold) initial conditions, in the hope that this will ultimately help to distinguish between different physical mechanisms of planet formation. However, the exact entropies and radii of newly formed planets due to these two modes of formation cannot, at present, be precisely predicted. It is possible that the distribution of properties of core-accretion-formed planets and the distribution of properties of disk-instability-formed planets overlap. We, therefore, introduce a broad range of ``warm-start'' gas-giant planet models. Between the hottest and the coldest models that we consider, differences in radii, temperatures, luminosities, and spectra persist for only a few million to a few tens of millions of years for planets that are a few times Jupiter's mass or less. For planets that are {$\sim$}five times Jupiter's mass or more, significant differences between hottest-start and coldest-start models persist for on the order of 100 Myr. We find that out of the standard infrared bands (J, H, K, L{$\prime$}, M, N) the K and H bands are the most diagnostic of the initial conditions. A hottest-start model can be from {$\sim$}4.5 mag brighter (at Jupiter's mass) to {$\sim$}9 mag brighter (at 10 times Jupiter's mass) than a coldest-start model in the first few million years. In more massive objects, these large differences in luminosity and spectrum persist for much longer than in less massive objects. Finally, we consider the influence of atmospheric conditions on spectra, and find that the presence or absence of clouds, and the metallicity of an atmosphere, can affect an object's apparent brightness in different bands by up to several magnitudes.},

High resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) offers a robust avenue for developing techniques to extract exoplanet reflection spectra.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We aimed to extract the optical reflected light spectrum of the non-transiting hot Jupiter 51 Pegasi b by adapting techniques designed to remove tellurics in infrared HRCCS to instead remove optical stellar lines.

This 'birthline' is in striking agreement with observations of T Tauri stars, providing a strong confirmation of the fact that these stars are indeed contracting along Hayashi tracks. The assumption that most T Tauri stars first appear along this line forces a recalibration of their ages. This recalibration removes the puzzling dip in present-day star formation seen in age histograms of several cloud complexes. Since the underlying protostar calculation assumes that the parent cloud was only thermally supported prior to its collapse, the observed location of the birthline places severe restrictions on the degree of extrathermal support provided by rotation, magnetic fields, or turbulence. In addition, the hypothesis that the collapse from thermally supported clouds to low-mass stars proceeds through protostellar disks appears untenable, since the disk accretion process almost certainly produces pre-main-sequence stars with radii well below the observed birthline.},

  abstract = {We suggest that a high proportion of brown dwarf (BD) stars are formed by gravitational fragmentation of massive extended discs around Sun-like primary stars. We argue that such discs should arise frequently, but should be observed infrequently, precisely because they fragment rapidly. By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we show that such discs typically fragment within a few thousand years, and produce mainly BD stars, but also planetary-mass (PM) stars and very low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Subsequently most of the lower mass stars (i.e. the PM and BD stars) are ejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these stars, and compare them with observations.After a few hundred thousand years the Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and two much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD--BD binary. The orbits of these companions are highly eccentric, and not necessarily coplanar, either with one another, or with the original disc. There is a BD desert extending out to at least {$\sim$}100 au; this is because BDs tend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be scattered even further out, or even into the field.BDs form with discs of a few Jupiter masses and radii of a few tens of au, and they are more likely to retain these discs if they remain bound to the primary star. Binaries form by pairing of the newly formed stars in the disc, giving a low-mass binary fraction of {$\sim$}0.16. These binaries include close and wide BD/BD binaries and BD/PM binaries. Binaries can be ejected into the field and survive, even if they have quite wide separations. BDs that remain as companions to Sun-like stars are more likely to be in BD/BD binaries than are BDs ejected into the field. The presence of close and distant companions around Sun-like stars may inhibit planet formation by core accretion.We conclude that disc fragmentation is a robust mechanism for BD formation. Even if only a small fraction of Sun-like stars host the required massive extended discs, this mechanism can produce all the PM stars observed, most of the BD stars and a significant proportion of the very low-mass HB stars.},

  abstract = {The gaseous envelope of an accreting rocky planet becomes hot enough to sublimate silicates and other refractory minerals. \% aims heading (mandatory) For this work, we studied the effect of the resulting envelope enrichment with a heavy vapor species on the composition and temperature of the envelope. For simplification, we used the gas-phase molecule SiO to represent the sublimation of silicate material. We solved the equilibrium structure equations in 1D for planets in the mass range of \$0.1\$ to \$3{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. The convective stability criterion was extended to take the stabilizing effect of the condensation of SiO clouds into account. We assumed that the envelope is both in hydrostatic equilibrium and in vapor equilibrium with the underlying magma ocean. This means that pebbles do not undergo sublimation in the envelope and therefore survive until they plunge into the magma ocean. We find that the emergence of an inner radiative region, where SiO condensation suppresses convection, increases the pressure and temperature in the inner envelope compared to pure H\$\_2\$/He envelopes once \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pl\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.3{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. For \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pl\}{$>$}0.75{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, the temperature and pressure close to the surface reach the supercritical point of SiO. The amount of SiO stored in the envelope is lower than the total planet mass for low mass planets. However, for \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pl\}{$>$}2.0{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, all accreted pebble material must contribute to maintain the vapor equilibrium in the envelope. Therefore, the non-vapor mass of the planet ceases to increase beyond this threshold. Overall, our vapor equilibrium model of the planetary envelope allows for direct core growth by pebble accretion up to much higher masses than previously thought.},

Two consecutive observing nights at the ESO Very Large Telescope with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph yielded a time series with a resolution of {\textasciitilde}12 minutes. Additional high-resolution optical spectra were obtained months apart at the Magellan Clay telescope using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) instrument. Combined with previously published results, these data allow us to investigate changes in the emission line spectrum of 2M 1207 on timescales of hours to years. Most of the emission line profiles of 2M 1207 are broad, in particular that of H{$\alpha$}, indicating that the dominant fraction of the emission must be attributed to disk accretion rather than to magnetic activity. From the H{$\alpha$} 10\% width, we deduce a relatively stable accretion rate between 10-10.1 and 10-9.8 Msolar yr-1 for two nights of consecutive observations. Therefore, either the accretion stream is nearly homogeneous over (sub)stellar longitude, or the system is seen face-on. Small but significant variations are evident throughout our near-continuous observation, and they reach a maximum after {\textasciitilde}8 hr, roughly the timescale on which maximum variability is expected across the rotation cycle. Together with past measurements, we confirm that the accretion rate of 2M 1207 varies by more than 1 order of magnitude on timescales of months to years. Such variable mass accretion yields a plausible explanation for the observed spread in the M˙-M diagram. The magnetic field required to drive the funnel flow is on the order of a few hundred G. Despite the obvious presence of a magnetic field, neither radio nor X-ray emission has been reported for 2M 1207. It is possible that strong accretion suppresses magnetic activity in brown dwarfs, similar to the findings for higher mass T Tauri stars.},

  abstract = {M dwarfs are the most numerous stars in the Galaxy. They are characterized by strong magnetic activity. The ensuing high-energy emission is crucial for the evolution of their planets and the eventual presence of life on them. We systematically study the X-ray and ultraviolet emission of a subsample of M~dwarfs from a recent proper-motion survey, selecting all M~dwarfs within 10\,pc to obtain a nearly volume-limited sample ({$\sim$}90~per\,cent completeness). Archival ROSAT, XMM--Newton and GALEX data are combined with published spectroscopic studies of H{$\alpha$} emission and rotation to obtain a broad picture of stellar activity on M~dwarfs. We make use of synthetic model spectra to determine the relative contributions of photospheric and chromospheric emission to the ultraviolet flux. We also analyse the same diagnostics for a comparison sample of young M~dwarfs in the TW\,Hya association ({$\sim$}10\,Myr). We find that generally the emission in the GALEX bands is dominated by the chromosphere but the photospheric component is not negligible in early-M field dwarfs. The surface fluxes for the H{$\alpha$}, near-ultraviolet, far-ultraviolet and X-ray emission are connected via a power-law dependence. We present here for the first time such flux--flux relations involving broad-band ultraviolet emission for M~dwarfs. Activity indices are defined as flux ratio between the activity diagnostic and the bolometric flux of the star in analogy to the Ca\,iiR{$\prime$}HK index. For given spectral type, these indices display a spread of 2--3 dex which is largest for M4 stars. Strikingly, at mid-M spectral types, the spread of rotation rates is also at its highest level. The mean activity index for fast rotators, likely representing the saturation level, decreases from X-rays over the FUV to the NUV band and H{$\alpha$}, i.e. the fractional radiation output increases with atmospheric height. The comparison to the ultraviolet and X-ray properties of TW\,Hya members shows a drop of nearly three orders of magnitude for the luminosity in these bands between~{$\sim$}10\,Myr and few\,Gyr age. A few young field dwarfs (\&lt;1\,Gyr) in the 10-pc sample bridge the gap indicating that the drop in magnetic activity with age is a continuous process. The slope of the age decay is steeper for the X-ray than for the UV luminosity.},

  abstract = {For the calculation of complex neutral/ionized gas-phase chemical equilibria, we present a semi-analytical, versatile, and efficient computer program, called FastChem. The applied method is based on the solution of a system of coupled non-linear (and linear) algebraic equations, namely the law of mass action and the element conservation equations including charge balance, in many variables. Specifically, the system of equations is decomposed into a set of coupled nonlinear equations in one variable each, which are solved analytically whenever feasible to reduce computation time. Notably, the electron density is determined by using the method of Nelder and Mead at low temperatures. The program is written in object-oriented C++ which makes it easy to couple the code with other programs, although a stand-alone version is provided. FastChem can be used in parallel or sequentially and is available under the GNU General Public License version 3 at https://github.com/exoclime/FastChem together with several sample applications. The code has been successfully validated against previous studies and its convergence behaviour has been tested even for extreme physical parameter ranges down to \$100{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$ and up to \$1000{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{bar\}\$. FastChem converges stable and robust in even most demanding chemical situations, which posed sometimes extreme challenges for previous algorithms.},

  abstract = {GQ Lup B is a young and accreting, substellar companion that appears to drive a spiral arm in the circumstellar disk of its host star. We report high-contrast imaging observations of GQ Lup B with VLT/NACO at 4--5 {$\mu$}m and medium-resolution integral field spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE. The optical spectrum is consistent with an M9 spectral type, shows characteristics of a low-gravity atmosphere, and exhibits strong H{$\alpha$} emission. The H - M{$\prime$} color is 1 mag redder than field dwarfs with similar spectral types, and a detailed analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED) from optical to mid-infrared wavelengths reveals excess emission in the L{$\prime$}, NB4.05, and M{$\prime$} bands. The excess flux is well described by a blackbody component with Tdisk {$\approx$} 460 K and Rdisk {$\approx$} 65 RJ and is expected to trace continuum emission from small grains in a protolunar disk. We derive an extinction of AV {$\approx$} 2.3 mag from the broadband SED with a suspected origin in the vicinity of the companion. We also combine 15 yr of astrometric measurements and constrain the mutual inclination with the circumstellar disk to 84 {\textpm} 9 deg, indicating a tumultuous dynamical evolution or a stellar-like formation pathway. From the measured H{$\alpha$} flux and the estimated companion mass, Mp {$\approx$} 30 MJ, we derive an accretion rate of M >> 10-6.5 MJ yr-1. We speculate that the disk is in a transitional stage in which the assembly of satellites from a pebble reservoir has opened a central cavity while GQ Lup B is in the final stages of its formation.},

The \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{12\}C/{\textasciicircum}\{13\}C\$ ratio in particular is often used as a proxy to determine other isotopic ratios, such as \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{16\}O/{\textasciicircum}\{18\}O\$ and \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{14\}N/{\textasciicircum}\{15\}N\$. Measurements of \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{12\}CN\$ and \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{13\}CN\$ (or \${\textbackslash}rm C{\textasciicircum}\{15\}N\$) -- with their optical depths corrected via their hyper-fine structure lines -- have traditionally been exploited to constrain the Galactocentric gradients of the CNO isotopic ratios. Such methods typically make several simplifying assumptions (e.g. a filling factor of unity, the Rayleigh--Jeans approximation, and the neglect of the cosmic microwave background) while adopting a single average gas phase. However, these simplifications introduce significant biases to the measured \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{12\}C/{\textasciicircum}\{13\}C\$ and \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{14\}N/{\textasciicircum}\{15\}N\$. We demonstrate that exploiting the optically thin satellite lines of 12CN constitutes a more reliable new method to derive \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{12\}C/{\textasciicircum}\{13\}C\$ and \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{14\}N/{\textasciicircum}\{15\}N\$ from CN isotopologues. We apply this satellite-line method to new IRAM 30-m observations of 12CN, 13CN, and C15N N~= 1 {$\rightarrow$} 0 towards 15 metal-poor molecular clouds in the Galactic outer disc (Rgc \&gt; 12\,kpc), supplemented by data from the literature. After updating their Galactocentric distances, we find that \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{12\}C/{\textasciicircum}\{13\}C\$ and \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{14\}N/{\textasciicircum}\{15\}N\$ gradients are in good agreement with those derived using independent optically thin molecular tracers, even in regions with the lowest metallicities. We therefore recommend using optically thin tracers for Galactic and extragalactic CNO isotopic measurements, which avoids the biases associated with the traditional method.},

While a line list for CN (an important molecule for chemistry and astrophysics) exists, no underlying energy spectroscopic model has been published, which is required to consider the sensitivity of transitions to a variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Here we have developed a Duo energy spectroscopic model as well as a novel hybrid style line list for CN and its isotopologues, combining energy levels that are derived experimentally (Marvel), using the traditional/perturbative approach (Mollist), and the variational approach (from a Duo spectroscopic model using standard ExoMol methodology). The final Trihybrid ExoMol-style line list for 12C14N consists of 28\,004 energy levels (6864 experimental, 1574 perturbative, the rest variational) and 2285\,103 transitions up to 60\,000~cm-1 between the three lowest electronic states (X~2{$\Sigma$}+, A~2{$\Pi$}, and B~2{$\Sigma$}+). The spectroscopic model created is used to evaluate CN as a molecular probe to constrain the variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio; no overly promising sensitive transitions for extragalactic study were identified.},

  abstract = {Context: SteParSyn is an automatic code written in Python 3.X designed to infer the stellar atmospheric parameters Teff, log(g), and [Fe/H] of FGKM-type stars following the spectral synthesis method. Aims: We present a description of the SteParSyn code and test its performance against a sample of late-type stars that were observed with the HERMES spectrograph mounted at the 1.2-m Mercator Telescope. This sample contains 35 late-type targets with well-known stellar parameters determined independently from spectroscopy. The code is available to the astronomical community in a GitHub repository. Methods: SteParSyn uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler to explore the parameter space by comparing synthetic model spectra generated on the fly to the observations. The synthetic spectra are generated with an spectral emulator. Results: We computed Teff, log(g), and [Fe/H] for our sample stars and discussed the performance of the code. We calculated an internal scatter for these targets of -12 +- 117 K in Teff, 0.04 +- 0.14 dex in log(g), and 0.05 +- 0.09 dex in [Fe/H]. In addition, we find that the log(g) values obtained with SteParSyn are consistent with the trigonometric surface gravities to the 0.1 dex level. Finally, SteParSyn can compute stellar parameters that are accurate down to 50 K, 0.1 dex, and 0.05 dex for Teff, log(g), and [Fe/H] for stars with vsini {$<$}= 30 km/s.},

Four molecular clouds (Lupus 1, 2, and 3 and a newly found cloud) were mapped using an 8{$\prime$} grid spacing. The masses of the four clouds were estimated to be 1200, 100, 300, and 1000 M{$\odot$}, respectively. Around an infrared point source, IRAS 15398--3359, associated with Lupus 1, we discovered a CO molecular outflow with a relatively short dynamical time scale of {$\sim$} 2000 yr, which indicates ongoing star formation in the Lupus region. Including the outflow source, about 50 candidates for young stellar objects can be found in the literature, which are apparently associated with 13CO clouds. Comparing these objects with our 13CO data, we find that the star-formation efficiency of the four clouds varies over a wide range from 0.4 to {$\geq$} 3.8\%, which might represent their different stages of star formation, or might be due to a difference in the interaction with the nearby Scorpius HI shell.},

The algorithm can remove systematic effects, such as those associated with atmospheric extinction, detector efficiency, or point spread function changes over the detector. The algorithm works without any prior knowledge of the effects, as long as they linearly appear in many stars of the sample. The approach, which was originally developed to remove atmospheric extinction effects, is based on a lower rank approximation of matrices, an approach which has already been suggested and used in chemometrics, for example. The proposed algorithm is especially useful in cases where the uncertainties of the measurements are unequal. For equal uncertainties, the algorithm reduces to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. We present a simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and we point out its potential, in the search for transit candidates in particular.},

  abstract = {How do stars that are more massive than the Sun form, and thus how is the stellar initial mass function (IMF) established? Such intermediate- and high-mass stars may be born from relatively massive pre-stellar gas cores, which are more massive than the thermal Jeans mass. The turbulent core accretion model invokes such cores as being in approximate virial equilibrium and in approximate pressure equilibrium with their surrounding clump medium. Their internal pressure is provided by a combination of turbulence and magnetic fields. Alternatively, the competitive accretion model requires strongly sub-virial initial conditions that then lead to extensive fragmentation to the thermal Jeans scale, with intermediate- and high-mass stars later forming by competitive Bondi--Hoyle accretion. To test these models, we have identified four prime examples of massive ({$\sim$}100 M ) clumps from midinfrared extinction mapping of infrared dark clouds. Fontani et al. found high deuteration fractions of N2H+ in these objects, which are consistent with them being starless. Here we present ALMA observations of these four clumps that probe the N2D+ (3--2) line at 2.3 resolution. We find six N2D+ cores and determine their dynamical state. Their observed velocity dispersions and sizes are broadly consistent with the predictions of the turbulent core model of self-gravitating, magnetized (with Alfve{\textasciiacute}n Mach number mA {$\sim$} 1) and virialized cores that are bounded by the high pressures of their surrounding clumps. However, in the most massive cores, with masses up to {$\sim$}60 M , our results suggest that moderately enhanced magnetic fields (so that mA 0.3) may be needed for the structures to be in virial and pressure equilibrium. Magnetically regulated core formation may thus be important in controlling the formation of massive cores, inhibiting their fragmentation, and thus helping to establish the stellar IMF.},

The physical characterization of SSSPM J1102 was based on the hypothesis that it forms a binary system with TW Hya. The recent discovery of a probable giant planet with a very short-period inside the TW Hya protoplanetary disk, as well as a disk around SSSPM J1102, make it especially interesting and important to measure well the physical parameters of SSSPM J1102.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}Trigonometric parallax and proper motion measurements of SSSPM J1102 are necessary to test for TWA membership and, thus, to determine the mass and age of this young brown dwarf and the possibility that it forms a wide binary system with TW Hya.\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}Two years of regular observations at the ESO NTT/SUSI2 telescope have enabled us to determine the trigonometric parallax and proper motion of SSSPM J1102.\emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}With our accurate distance determination of pc and proper motions of (-67.2,-14.0) \emph{{\textpm}{$<$}i/{$>$} 0.6 mas/yr, we could confirm SSSPM J1102 as a very probable member of TWA.

  abstract = {The desire to characterize and model the atmospheres of the many extrasolar planets that have been discovered over the last three decades is a major driver of current astronomy. However, this goal is impacted by the lack of spectroscopic data on the molecules in question. As most atmospheres that can be studied are hot, some surprisingly so, this activity requires spectroscopic information not readily available from laboratory studies. This article will review the current status of available molecular spectroscopic data, usually presented as line lists, for studies of exoplanet atmospheres and, indeed, the atmospheres of other astronomical objects hotter than the Earth such as brown dwarfs, cool stars and even sunspots. Analysis of exoplanet transit spectra and the calculation of the relevant opacities often require huge datasets comprising billions of individual spectroscopic transitions. Conversely, the newly-developed high-resolution Doppler-shift spectroscopy technique has proved to be a powerful tool for detecting molecular species in exoplanet atmospheres, but relies on the use of smaller, highly accurate line lists. Methods of resolving issues arising from the competing demands of completeness versus accuracy for line lists are discussed.},

We compute a set of new thermal and structural evolution models and use these models in comparison with properties of the 47 transiting planets (mass, radius, age) to determine their heavy element masses. A clear correlation emerges between the planetary heavy element mass               M                                z                              and the total planet mass, approximately of the form                                                                                                                   . This finding is consistent with the core-accretion model of planet formation. We also study how stellar metallicity [Fe/H] affects planetary metal-enrichment and find a weaker correlation than has previously been~reported from studies with smaller sample sizes. We confirm a strong relationship between the planetary metal-enrichment relative to the parent star               Z               planet               /               Z               star               and the planetary mass, but see no relation in               Z               planet               /               Z               star               with planet orbital properties or stellar mass. The large heavy element masses of many planets ({$>$}50               M               {$\oplus$}               ) suggest significant amounts of heavy elements in H/He envelopes, rather than cores, such that metal-enriched giant planet atmospheres should be the rule. We also discuss a model of core-accretion planet formation in a one-dimensional disk and show that it agrees well with our derived relation between mass and               Z               planet               /               Z               star               .},

However, the UV flux is partly unobservable due to interstellar absorption, particularly in the EUV range (100--912 {\AA}). It is therefore necessary to reconstruct the unobservable spectra in order to characterize the radiation environment of exoplanets. In the present work, we use a radiative transfer code SSRPM to build one-dimensional semiempirical models of two M dwarf exoplanet hosts, GJ 832 and GJ 581, and synthesize their spectra. SSRPM is equipped with an extensive atomic and molecular database and full-NLTE capabilities. We use observations in the visible, ultraviolet, and X-ray ranges to constrain atmospheric structures of the modeled stars. The synthesized integrated EUV fluxes are found to be in good agreement with other reconstruction techniques, but the spectral energy distributions disagree significantly across the EUV range. More than two-thirds of the EUV flux is formed above 105 K. We find that the far-ultraviolet (FUV) continuum contributes 42\%--54\% of the entire FUV flux between 1450 and 1700 {\AA}. The comparison of stellar structures of GJ 832 and GJ 581 suggests that GJ 832 is a more magnetically active star, which is corroborated by other activity indicators.},

Combined with previous interferometric and radial velocity measurements, these new data enable us to improve the characterization of the physical orbit of the A subsystem. In particular, we infer updated dynamical masses for the primary and the secondary components of 1.55 {\textpm} 0.11 M and 1.293 {\textpm} 0.068 M , respectively, and an updated orbital parallax distance to the system of 135.7 {\textpm} 3.2 pc, all consistent with previous estimates. Using the improved orbit, we can calculate the absolute coordinates of the barycenter of V773 Tau A at each epoch of our VLBA observations, and fit for its trigonometric parallax and proper motion. This provides a direct measurement of the distance to the system almost entirely independent of the orbit modeling. The best fit yields a distance of 129.9 {\textpm} 3.2 pc, in good agreement (i.e., within 1{$\sigma$} ) with the distance estimate based on the orbital fit. Taking the mean value of the orbital and trigonometric parallaxes, we conclude that V773 Tau is located at d = 132.8 {\textpm} 2.3 pc. The accuracy of this determination is nearly one order of magnitude better than that of previous estimates. In projection, V773 Tau and two other young stars (Hubble 4 and HDE 283572) recently observed with the VLBA are located toward the dark cloud Lynds 1495, in the central region of Taurus. These three stars appear to have similar trigonometric parallaxes, radial velocities, and proper motions, and we argue that the weighted mean and dispersion of their distances (d = 131.4 pc and {$\sigma$}d = 2.4 pc) provide a good estimate of the distance to and depth of Lynds 1495 and its associated stellar population. The radio emission from the two sources in V773 Tau A is largely of gyrosynchrotron origin. Interestingly, both sources are observed to become typically five times brighter near periastron than near apastron (presumably because of increased flaring activity), and the separation between the radio sources near periastron appears to be systematically smaller than the separation between the stars. While this clearly indicates some interaction between the individual magnetospheres, the exact mechanisms at play are unclear because even at periastron the separation between the stars ({$\sim$}30 R{$\ast$}) remain much larger than the radius of the magnetospheres around these low-mass young stars ({$\sim$}6 R{$\ast$}).},

  abstract = {This work aims to improve the current understanding of the atmospheres of brown dwarfs, especially cold ones with spectral types T and Y, whose modeling is a current challenge. Silicate and iron clouds are believed to disappear at the photosphere at the L/T transition, but cloudless models fail to reproduce correctly the spectra of T dwarfs, advocating for the addition of more physics, e.g., other types of clouds or internal energy transport mechanisms. We use a one-dimensional radiative/convective equilibrium code ATMO to investigate this issue. This code includes both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium chemistry and solves consistently the PT structure. Included opacity sources are H2-H2, H2-He, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, NH3, K, Na, and TiO, VO if they are present in the atmosphere. We show that the spectra of Y dwarfs can be accurately reproduced with a cloudless model if vertical mixing and NH3 quenching are taken into account. T dwarf spectra still have some reddening in, e.g., J--H, compared to cloudless models. This reddening can be reproduced by slightly reducing the temperature gradient in the atmosphere. We propose that this reduction of the stabilizing temperature gradient in these layers, leading to cooler structures, is due to the onset of fingering convection, triggered by the destabilizing impact of condensation of very thin dust.},

  abstract = {JWST has recently detected the first robust photochemical product on an exoplanet: sulfur dioxide (SO2) on WASP-39b. The data from the NIRISS instrument also reveal signs of partial coverage of clouds. Most of the previous studies have focused on interpreting spectral data with 1D models. To explore how the chemical species and cloud particles are altered by global circulation, we applied a 2D photochemical model and a 2D microphysical cloud model separately to postprocess the thermal and dynamical structures simulated by a 3D general circulation model of WASP-39b. We found that SO2 produced by photochemistry on the dayside can be transported to the nightside owing to the efficient replenishment of horizontal transport. The morning--evening limb differences in methane (CH4) abundances predicted by the 1D models disappeared after horizontal transport is included. Similarly, the inclusion of horizontal transport also reduced the limb differences in SO2. Our modeling results suggest that the fast zonal wind results in minimal or negligible limb asymmetry in composition. Based on the synthetic spectra generated by our 2D atmosphere simulations, we propose that observing SO2 absorption in the emission spectra of WASP-39b at different phases may offer opportunities to probe the horizontal quenching process of photochemical products. We will focus on the gas-phase chemistry in this paper and leave the results regarding clouds in the subsequent paper as part of the series.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Photochemistry is a fundamental process of planetary atmospheres that regulates the atmospheric composition and stability               1               . However, no unambiguous photochemical products have been detected in exoplanet atmospheres so far. Recent observations from the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Program               2,3               found a spectral absorption feature at 4.05\,{$\mu$}m arising from sulfur dioxide (SO               2               ) in the atmosphere of WASP-39b. WASP-39b is a 1.27-Jupiter-radii, Saturn-mass (0.28\,               M               J               ) gas giant exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star with an equilibrium temperature of around 1,100\,K (ref.\,               4               ). The most plausible way of generating SO               2               in such an atmosphere is through photochemical processes               5,6               . Here we show that the SO               2               distribution computed by a suite of photochemical models robustly explains the 4.05-{$\mu$}m spectral feature identified by JWST transmission observations               7               with NIRSpec PRISM (2.7               {$\sigma$}               )               8               and G395H (4.5               {$\sigma$}               )               9               . SO               2               is produced by successive oxidation of sulfur radicals freed when hydrogen sulfide (H               2               S) is destroyed. The sensitivity of the SO               2               feature to the enrichment of the atmosphere by heavy elements (metallicity) suggests that it can be used as a tracer of atmospheric properties, with WASP-39b exhibiting an inferred metallicity of about 10{\texttimes} solar. We further point out that SO               2               also shows observable features at ultraviolet and thermal infrared wavelengths not available from the existing observations.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of 20 T and Y dwarfs using spectroscopy from the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) CLEAR/PRISM and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) low-resolution spectrometer instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope. To characterize the atmospheric parameters, we utilize two atmospheric model grids: the Sonora Elf Owl and ATMO2020++. The effective temperatures derived from the two models are relatively consistent, and metallicities are both close to solar values. However, significant discrepancies are found in other parameters, particularly in surface gravity, with the values obtained from the Sonora Elf Owl models typically being about 1 dex lower than those from the ATMO2020++ models. Further comparisons using the ATMO2020 models highlight that the adiabatic convective process introduced in the ATMO2020++ models has a significant impact on the determination of surface gravity. Using the fitted effective temperatures and absolute parallaxes from the literature, we derive radii for the brown dwarfs, which range from approximately 0.8--1.2 R Jup. The estimated masses and ages, derived using evolutionary tracks, indicate that most brown dwarfs in our sample have masses below 30 M Jup and are younger than 6 Gyr. Specifically, Y dwarfs have masses ranging from 2 to 20 M Jup and ages between 0.1 and 6.7 Gyr. In addition, we discuss the determination of atmospheric parameters using only NIRSpec or MIRI spectra. Comparisons with results from the combined spectra show that the effective temperatures and surface gravities derived solely from NIRSpec spectra are largely consistent with those obtained from the combined spectra.},

  abstract = {The composition of giant planets is imprinted by their migration history and the compositional structure of their hosting disks. Studies in recent literature investigate how the abundances of C and O can constrain the formation pathways of giant planets forming within few tens of au from the star. New ALMA observations, however, suggest planet-forming regions possibly extending to hundreds of au. We explore the implications of these wider formation environments through n-body simulations of growing and migrating giant planets embedded in planetesimal disks, coupled with a compositional model of the protoplanetary disk where volatiles are inherited from the molecular cloud and refractories are calibrated against extrasolar and Solar System data. We find that the C/O ratio provides limited insight on the formation pathways of giant planets that undergo large-scale migration. This limitation can be overcome thanks to nitrogen and sulphur. Jointly using the C/N, N/O and C/O ratios breaks any degeneracy in the formation and migration tracks of giant planets. The use of elemental ratios normalized to the respective stellar ratios supplies additional information on the nature of giant planets, thanks to the relative volatility of O, C and N in disks. When the planetary metallicity is dominated by the accretion of solids C/N* \${$>\$$} C/O* \${$>\$$} N/O* (* denoting this normalized scale), otherwise N/O* \${$>\$$} C/O* \${$>\$$} C/N*. The S/N ratio provides an additional independent probe into the metallicity of giant planets and their accretion of solids.},

  abstract = {The age-metallicity relation for the disk in the neighborhood of the sun is derived from four-color and H-beta photometry of a large sample of southern F dwarfs, analyzed in combination with theoretical isochrones. It is found that the mean metallicity of the disk increased by about a factor of five between 12 and 5 billion years ago and has increased only slightly since then. The star formation rate (SFR) for the disk as a function of time is obtained from the number count data, taking into account stellar evolution and the disk scale height corrections. The SFR which produces a metallicity distribution for the F stars consistent with the G dwarf data is one where the SFR has remained relatively constant over the lifetime of the disk. It is concluded that the disk has collapsed by about a factor of 6 perpendicular to the galactic plane during its lifetime, most of the collapse occurring 13 to 7 billion years ago.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} We present the third data release of the European Space Agency's \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} mission, \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3. This release includes a large variety of new data products, notably a much expanded radial velocity survey and a very extensive astrophysical characterisation of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} sources.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We outline the content and the properties of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3, providing an overview of the main improvements in the data processing in comparison with previous data releases (where applicable) and a brief discussion of the limitations of the data in this release.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} The \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}, \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$}, and \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$} pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release, \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3. \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RVS{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 14 and 3100 {$<$} \emph{T{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 14 500, have new determinations of their mean radial velocities based on data collected by \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}. We provide \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RVS{$<$}sub/{$>$} magnitudes for most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed for a subset of these. Mean \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} spectra are made available to the community. The \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism photometer BP/RP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3 includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470 million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some 800 000 astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than 150 000 Solar System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra derived from the epoch BP/RP spectral data are published for about 60 000 asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} Andromeda Photometric Survey, consisting of the photometric time series for all sources located in a 5.5 degree radius field centred on the Andromeda galaxy.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} This data release represents a major advance with respect to \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 and \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 because of the unprecedented quantity, quality, and variety of source astrophysical data. To date this is the largest collection of all-sky spectrophotometry, radial velocities, variables, and astrophysical parameters derived from both low- and high-resolution spectra and includes a spectrophotometric and dynamical survey of SSOs of the highest accuracy. The non-single star content surpasses the existing data by orders of magnitude. The quasar host and galaxy light profile collection is the first such survey that is all sky and space based. The astrophysical information provided in \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3 will unleash the full potential of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}'s exquisite astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity surveys.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {K2 observations of the weak-lined T Tauri binary V928 Tau A+B show the detection of a single, asymmetric eclipse which may be due to a previously unknown substellar companion eclipsing one component of the binary with an orbital period \${$>\$$} 66 days. Over an interval of about 9 hours, one component of the binary dims by around 60\%, returning to its normal brightness about 5 hours later. From modeling of the eclipse shape we find evidence that the eclipsing companion may be surrounded by a disk or a vast ring system. The modeled disk has a radius of \$0.9923{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}pm{\textbackslash},0.0005{\textbackslash},R\_*\$, with an inclination of \$56.78{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}pm{\textbackslash}, 0.03{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, a tilt of \$41.22{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}pm{\textbackslash},0.05{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, an impact parameter of \$-0.2506{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}pm{\textbackslash},0.0002{\textbackslash},R\_*\$ and an opacity of 1.00. The occulting disk must also move at a transverse velocity of \$6.637{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}pm{\textbackslash},0.002{\textbackslash},R\_*{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{day\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, which depending on whether it orbits V928 Tau A or B, corresponds to approximately 73.53 or 69.26 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. A search in ground based archival data reveals additional dimming events, some of which suggest periodicity, but no unambiguous period associated with the eclipse observed by K2. We present a new epoch of astrometry which is used to further refine the orbit of the binary, presenting a new lower bound of 67 years, and constraints on the possible orbital periods of the eclipsing companion. The binary is also separated by 18" (\${\textbackslash}sim\$2250 au) from the lower mass CFHT-BD-Tau 7, which is likely associated with V928 Tau A+B. We also present new high dispersion optical spectroscopy that we use to characterize the unresolved stellar binary.},

  abstract = {Observations of the star EPIC 220208795 (2MASS J01105556+0018507) reveal a single, deep and asymmetric eclipse, which we hypothesize is due to an eclipsing companion surrounded by a tilted and inclined opaque disk, similar to those seen around V928 Tau and EPIC 204376071. We aim to derive physical parameters of the disk and orbital parameters for the companion around the primary star. The modeling is carried out using a modified version of the python package pyPplusS, and optimization is done using emcee. The period analysis makes use of photometry from ground-based surveys, where we perform a period folding search for other possible eclipses by the disk. Parameters obtained by the best model fits are used to obtain the parameter space of the orbital parameters, while the most likely period obtained is used to constrain these parameters. The best model has an opaque disk with a radius of \$1.14{\textbackslash}pm0.03\$ \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, an impact parameter of \$0.61{\textbackslash}pm0.02\$ \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, an inclination of \$77.01{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}{\textbackslash}pm0.03{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$, a tilt of \$36.81{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}{\textbackslash}pm0.05{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ and a transverse velocity of \$77.45{\textbackslash}pm0.05\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. The two most likely periods are \${\textbackslash}sim 290\$ days and \${\textbackslash}sim 236\$ days, corresponding to an eccentricity of \${\textbackslash}sim 0.7\$, allowing us to make predictions for the epochs of the next eclipses. All models with tilted and inclined disks result in a minimum derived eccentricity of 0.3, which in combination with the two other known small transiting disk candidates V928 Tau and EPIC 204376071, suggest that there may be a common origin for their eccentric orbits.},

  abstract = {Methods. We observed the companions with the high-contrast imaging polarimeter SPHERE-IRDIS at the Very Large Telescope. We reduced the data using the IRDAP pipeline to correct for the instrumental polarization and crosstalk of the optical system with an absolute polarimetric accuracy {$<$}0.1\% in the degree of polarization. We employed aperture photometry, angular differential imaging, and point-spread-function fitting to retrieve the polarization of the companions. Results. We report the first detection of polarization originating from substellar companions, with a polarization of several tenths of a percent for DH Tau B and GSC 6214-210 B in H-band. By comparing the measured polarization with that of nearby stars, we find that the polarization is unlikely to be caused by interstellar dust. Because the companions have previously measured hydrogen emission lines and red colors, the polarization most likely originates from circumsubstellar disks. Through radiative transfer modeling, we constrain the position angles of the disks and find that the disks must have high inclinations. For the 18 other companions, we do not detect significant polarization and place subpercent upper limits on their degree of polarization. We also present images of the circumstellar disks of DH Tau, GQ Lup, PDS 70, {$\beta$} Pic, and HD 106906. We detect a highly asymmetric disk around GQ Lup and find evidence for multiple scattering in the disk of PDS 70. Both disks show spiral-like features that are potentially induced by GQ Lup B and PDS 70 b, respectively. Conclusions. The presence of the disks around DH Tau B and GSC 6214-210 B as well as the misalignment of the disk of DH Tau B with the disk around its primary star suggest in situ formation of the companions. The non-detections of polarization for the other companions may indicate the absence of circumsubstellar disks, a slow rotation rate of young companions, the upper atmospheres containing primarily submicron-sized dust grains, and/or limited cloud inhomogeneity.},

The central eclipse is surrounded by two 1 mag eclipses at {\textpm}12 and {\textpm}26 d. The authors speculate that the star is eclipsed by a substellar companion with an extended and highly structured ring system. To investigate the nightly light-curve structure and to confirm the multiple-ring hypothesis, we have carried out a calibrated reduction of the SuperWASP data, removing both systematic errors and periodic stellar variability. We count at least 24 inflection points on ingress and 16 on egress, consistent with the presence of at least 24 rings in this disc. By measuring the light-curve slope, we find implied speeds for the eclipsing object that are incompatible with a closed Kepler orbit with P = 2.3 yr. We propose several scenarios that could give rise to such light-curve slopes and find that azimuthal ring structure (analogous to `spokes' seen in Saturn's rings) can account for the observed light curve. The highly structured ring system also implies the presence of exomoons orbiting the secondary companion.},

  abstract = {We discuss the evolution of stars through the asymptotic giant branch, focusing on the physical mechanisms potentially able to alter the surface chemical composition and on how changes in the chemistry of the external regions affect the physical properties of the star and the duration of this evolutionary phase. We focus on the differences between the evolution of low-mass stars, driven by the growth of the core mass and by the surface carbon enrichment, and that of their higher mass counterparts, which experience hot bottom burning. In the latter sources, the variation of the surface chemical composition reflects the equilibria of the proton capture nucleosynthesis experienced at the base of the convective envelope. The pollution expected from this class of stars is discussed, outlining the role of mass and metallicity on the chemical composition of the ejecta. To this aim, we considered evolutionary models of 0.7--8 M{$\odot$} stars in a wide range of metallicities, extending from the ultra-metal-poor domain to super-solar chemistries.},

  abstract = {Methods. Our sample comprises eleven TWA members with infrared excess, amounting to 85\% of the total TWA population with disks. Our targets span spectral types between M0 and M9, and masses between 0.58 M and 0.02 M . We employed homogeneous spectroscopic data from 300 nm to 2500 nm, obtained synoptically with the X-shooter spectrograph, to derive the individual extinction, stellar parameters, and accretion parameters for each object simultaneously. We then examined the luminosity of Balmer lines and forbidden emission lines to probe the physics of the star--disk interaction environment. Results. Disk-bearing stars represent around 24\% of the total TWA population. We detected signatures of ongoing accretion for 70\% of our TWA targets for which accurate measurements of the stellar parameters could be derived. This implies a fraction of accretors between 13--17\% across the entire TWA (that accounts for the disk-bearing and potentially accreting members not included in our survey). The spectral emission associated with these stars reveals a more evolved stage of these accretors compared to younger PMS populations studied with the same instrument and analysis techniques (e.g., Lupus): first, a large fraction ({$\sim$}50\%) exhibit nearly symmetric, narrow H{$\alpha$} line profiles; second, over 80\% of them exhibit Balmer decrements that are consistent with moderate accretion activity and optically thin emission; third, less than a third exhibit forbidden line emission in [O I] 6300 {\AA}, which is indicative of winds and outflows activity; and fourth, only one sixth exhibit signatures of collimated jets. However, the distribution in accretion rates (M˙ acc) derived for the TWA sample closely follows that of younger regions (Lupus, Chamaeleon I, {$\sigma$} Orionis) over the mass range of overlap (M {$\sim$} 0.1--0.3 M ). An overall correlation between M˙ acc and M is detected and best reproduced by the function M˙ acc {$\propto$} M2.1{\textpm}0.5. Conclusion. At least in the lowest M regimes, stars that still retain a disk at ages {$\sim$}8--10 Myr are found to exhibit statistically similar, albeit moderate, accretion levels as those measured around younger objects. This ``slow'' M˙ acc evolution that is apparent at the lowest masses may be associated with longer evolutionary timescales of disks around low-mass stars, which is suggested by the mass-dependent disk fractions reported in the literature within individual clusters.},

  abstract = {Direct imaging searches have begun to detect planetary and brown dwarf companions and to place constraints on the presence of giant planets at large separations from their host star. This work helps to motivate such planet searches by predicting a population of young giant planets that could be detectable by direct imaging campaigns. Both the classical core accretion and the gravitational instability model for planet formation are hard pressed to form long-period planets in situ. Here, we show that dynamical instabilities among planetary systems that originally formed multiple giant planets much closer to the host star could produce a population of giant planets at large ({$\approx$} 102-105 AU) separations. We estimate the limits within which these planets may survive, quantify the efficiency of gravitational scattering into both stable and unstable wide orbits, and demonstrate that population analyses must take into account the age of the system. We predict that planet scattering creates detectable giant planets on wide orbits that decreases in number on timescales of {\textasciitilde} 10 Myr. We demonstrate that several members of such populations should be detectable with current technology, quantify the prospects for future instruments, and suggest how they could place interesting constraints on planet formation models.},

  abstract = {The SpHere INfrared Exoplanet (SHINE) project is a 500-star survey performed with SPHERE on the Very Large Telescope for the purpose of directly detecting new substellar companions and understanding their formation and early evolution. Here we present an initial statistical analysis for a subsample of 150 stars spanning spectral types from B to M that are representative of the full SHINE sample. Our goal is to constrain the frequency of substellar companions with masses between 1 and 75               M               Jup               and semimajor axes between 5 and 300 au. For this purpose, we adopt detection limits as a function of angular separation from the survey data for all stars converted into mass and projected orbital separation using the BEX-COND-hot evolutionary tracks and known distance to each system. Based on the results obtained for each star and on the 13 detections in the sample, we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo tool to compare our observations to two different types of models. The first is a parametric model based on observational constraints, and the second type are numerical models that combine advanced core accretion and gravitational instability planet population synthesis. Using the parametric model, we show that the frequencies of systems with at least one substellar companion are 23.0               -9.7               +13.5               , 5.8               -2.8               +4.7               , and 12.6               -7.1               +12.9               \% for BA, FGK, and M stars, respectively. We also demonstrate that a planet-like formation pathway probably dominates the mass range from 1--75               M               Jup               for companions around BA stars, while for M dwarfs, brown dwarf binaries dominate detections. In contrast, a combination of binary star-like and planet-like formation is required to best fit the observations for FGK stars. Using our population model and restricting our sample to FGK stars, we derive a frequency of 5.7               -2.8               +3.8               \%, consistent with predictions from the parametric model. More generally, the frequency values that we derive are in excellent agreement with values obtained in previous studies.},

  abstract = {Understanding the formation and evolution of giant planets ({$\geq$}1 MJup) at wide orbital separation ({$\geq$}5 AU) is one of the goals of direct imaging. Over the past 15 yr, many surveys have placed strong constraints on the occurrence rate of wide-orbit giants, mostly based on non-detections, but very few have tried to make a direct link with planet formation theories. In the present work, we combine the results of our previously published VLT/NaCo large program with the results of 12 past imaging surveys to constitute a statistical sample of 199 FGK stars within 100 pc, including three stars with sub-stellar companions. Using Monte Carlo simulations and assuming linear flat distributions for the mass and semi-major axis of planets, we estimate the sub-stellar companion frequency to be within 0.75--5.70\% at the 68\% confidence level (CL) within 20--300 AU and 0.5--75 MJup, which is compatible with previously published results. We also compare our results with the predictions of state-of-the-art population synthesis models based on the gravitational instability (GI) formation scenario with and without scattering. We estimate that in both the scattered and non-scattered populations, we would be able to detect more than 30\% of companions in the 1--75 MJup range (95\% CL). With the three sub-stellar detections in our sample, we estimate the fraction of stars that host a planetary system formed by GI to be within 1.0--8.6\% (95\% CL). We also conclude that even though GI is not common, it predicts a mass distribution of wide-orbit massive companions that is much closer to what is observed than what the core accretion scenario predicts. Finally, we associate the present paper with the release of the Direct Imaging Virtual Archive (DIVA), a public database that aims at gathering the results of past, present, and future direct imaging surveys.},

Recent observations of C, N, and O isotopic abundances are reported which confirm that C-12/C-13 ratios in the interstellar medium are about half the solar-system value, that N and O abundance gradients exist in spiral galaxies, and that more luminous stars have lower C-12/C-13 ratios. A formalism for analyzing the evolution of C, N, and O abundances without using the instant recycling approximation is outlined. This formalism is employed to investigate the evolution of the gas fraction, rates of nova and supernova explosions, and abundances as well as isotopic ratios of C, N, and O in two situations modeling the solar neighborhood and the galactic center. It is found that: (1) the evolution of C, N, and O abundances and isotopic ratios is well reproduced in the models considered; (2) stars of less than 5 solar masses have a greater influence on galactic chemical evolution than higher-mass stars after times of about 1 billion years; and (3) models with moderate infall of extragalactic matter give satisfactory results for the evolution of the C-12/C-13 ratio in both the solar neighborhood and the galactic center.},

  abstract = {SciPy is an open source scientific computing library for the Python programming language. SciPy 1.0 was released in late 2017, about 16 years after the original version 0.1 release. SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in the Python programming language, with more than 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories, and millions of downloads per year. This includes usage of SciPy in almost half of all machine learning projects on GitHub, and usage by high profile projects including LIGO gravitational wave analysis and creation of the first-ever image of a black hole (M87). The library includes functionality spanning clustering, Fourier transforms, integration, interpolation, file I/O, linear algebra, image processing, orthogonal distance regression, minimization algorithms, signal processing, sparse matrix handling, computational geometry, and statistics. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of the SciPy library and highlight some recent technical developments.},

  abstract = {\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We numerically studied the formation of giant planet (GP) and brown dwarf (BD) embryos in gravitationally unstable protostellar disks and compared our findings with the directly imaged, wide-orbit ({$\greaterequivlnt$}50 AU) companions that are known to-date. The viability of the disk fragmentation scenario for the formation of wide-orbit companions in protostellar disks around (sub-)solar mass stars was investigated. We focused on the likelihood of survival of GP/BD embryos formed via disk gravitational fragmentation.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We used numerical hydrodynamics simulations of disk formation and evolution with an accurate treatment of disk thermodynamics. Using the thin-disk limit allowed us to probe the long-term evolution of protostellar disks, starting from the gravitational collapse of a pre-stellar core and ending in the T Tauri phase after at least 1.0 Myr of disk evolution. We focused on models that produced wide-orbit GP/BD embryos that opened a gap in the disk and showed radial migration timescales similar to or longer than the typical disk lifetime.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} While most models showed disk fragmentation, only 6 models out of 60 revealed the formation of quasi-stable, wide-orbit GP/BD embryos. The low probability for the fragment survival is caused by efficient inward migration/ejection/dispersal mechanisms that operate in the embedded phase of star formation. We found that only massive and extended protostellar disks ({$\greaterequivlnt$}0.2 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}), which experience gravitational fragmentation not only in the embedded but also in the T Tauri phases of star formation, can form wide-orbit companions. Disk fragmentation produced GP/BD embryos with masses in the 3.5--43 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{J{$<$}sub/{$>$} range, covering the whole mass spectrum of directly imaged, wide-orbit companions to (sub-)solar mass stars. On the other hand, our modeling failed to produce embryos on orbital distances {$\lessequivlnt$}170 AU, whereas several directly imaged companions were found at smaller orbits down to a few AU. Disk fragmentation also failed to produce wide-orbit companions around stars with mass {$\lessequivlnt$}0.7 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, in disagreement with observations. \emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} Disk fragmentation is unlikely to explain the whole observed spectrum of wide-orbit companions to (sub-)solar-mass stars and other formation mechanisms, for instance, dynamical scattering of closely packed companions onto wide orbits, should be invoked to account for companions at orbital distance from a few tens to {$\approx$}150 AU and wide-orbit companions with masses of the host star {$\leq$} 0.7 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}. Definite measurements of orbit eccentricities and a wider sample of numerical models are needed to distinguish between the formation scenarios of GP/BD on wide orbits.}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The nearby transiting rocky exoplanet LTT 1445A b presents an ideal target for studying atmospheric retention in terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs. It is cooler than many rocky exoplanets yet tested for atmospheres, receiving a bolometric instellation similar to Mercury's. Previous transmission spectroscopy ruled out a light H/He-dominated atmosphere but could not distinguish between a bare-rock, a high-MMW, or a cloudy atmosphere. We present new secondary eclipse observations using JWST's MIRI/LRS, covering the 5-12 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m range. From these observations, we detect a broadband secondary eclipse depth of 41 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 9 ppm and measure a mid-eclipse timing consistent with a circular orbit (at 1.7\${\textbackslash}sigma\$). From its emission spectrum, the planet's dayside brightness temperature is constrained to 525 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 15 K, yielding a temperature ratio relative to the maximum average dayside temperature from instant thermal reradiation by a rocky surface \$R\$ = \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm day,obs\}/T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ = 0.952 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.057, consistent with emission from a dark rocky surface. From an energy balance perspective, such a warm dayside temperature disfavors thick atmospheres, excluding \${\textbackslash}sim\$100 bar atmospheres with Bond albedo \${$>\$$} 0.08 at the 3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ level. Furthermore, forward modeling of atmospheric emission spectra disfavor simple 100{\textbackslash}\% CO\$\_2\$ atmospheres with surface pressures of 1, 10, and 100 bar at 4.2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$, 6.6\${\textbackslash}sigma\$, and 6.8\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence, respectively. These results suggest that LTT 1445A b lacks a very thick CO\$\_2\$ atmosphere, possibly due to atmospheric erosion driven by stellar activity. However, the presence of a moderately thin atmosphere (similar to those on Mars, Titan, or Earth) remains uncertain.},

  abstract = {A major outstanding question regarding the formation of planetary systems is whether wide-orbit giant planets form differently than close-in giant planets. We aim to establish constraints on two key parameters that are relevant for understanding the formation of wide-orbit planets: (1) the relative mass function and (2) the fraction of systems hosting multiple companions. In this study, we focus on systems with directly imaged substellar companions and the detection limits on lower mass bodies within these systems. First, we uniformly derive the mass probability distributions of known companions. We then combine the information contained within the detections and detection limits into a survival analysis statistical framework to estimate the underlying mass function of the parent distribution. Finally, we calculate the probability that each system may host multiple substellar companions. We find that (1) the companion mass distribution is rising steeply toward smaller masses, with a functional form of N{$\propto$}M-1.3{\textpm}0.03, and consequently, (2) many of these systems likely host additional undetected substellar companions. Combined, these results strongly support the notion that wide-orbit giant planets are formed predominantly via core accretion, similar to the better studied close-in giant planets. Finally, given the steep rise in the relative mass function with decreasing mass, these results suggest that future deep observations should unveil a greater number of directly imaged planets.},

  abstract = {Deciphering the role of clouds is central to our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres, as they have a direct impact on the temperature and pressure structure, and observational properties of the planet. Super-hot Jupiters occupy a temperature regime similar to low-mass M-dwarfs, where minimal cloud condensation is expected. However, observations of exoplanets such as WASP-12b (Teq {$\sim$} 2500 K) result in a transmission spectrum indicative of a cloudy atmosphere. We re-examine the temperature and pressure space occupied by these super-hot Jupiter atmospheres, to explore the role of the initial Al- and Ti-bearing condensates as the main source of cloud material. Due to the high temperatures, a majority of the more common refractory material is not depleted into deeper layers and would remain in the vapour phase. The lack of depletion into deeper layers means that these materials with relatively low cloud masses can become significant absorbers in the upper atmosphere. We provide condensation curves for the initial Al- and Ti-bearing condensates which may be used to provide quantitative estimates of the effect of metallicity on cloud masses, as planets with metal-rich hosts potentially form more opaque clouds because more mass is available for condensation. Increased metallicity also pushes the point of condensation to hotter, deeper layers in the planetary atmosphere further increasing the density of the cloud. We suggest that planets around metal-rich hosts are more likely to have thick refractory clouds, and discuss the implication on the observed spectra of WASP-12b.},

  abstract = {Methods. We compiled the elemental abundances of a sample of up to 43 M dwarfs for ten major rock-forming elements (Fe, C, O, Mg, Si, Al, Ca, Na, Ni, and Ti) from high-resolution near-infrared stellar surveys including APOGEE, CARMENES, and Subaru. We carried out bootstrap-based linear regressions on the selected sample of M dwarfs to constrain the statistical trends of [X/H] versus [Fe/H] and then compare them with those of GK dwarfs (sampled from the GALAH database). We then applied a two-sample, multivariate Mahalanobis Distance test to assess the significance of the differences in the [X/H]--[Fe/H] trends for individual elemental pairs between M and GK dwarfs. Results. We find that the null hypothesis -- that is, no significant difference in the chemical trends of [X/H] versus [Fe/H] between M and GK dwarfs -- is strongly rejected for all elements except for Si, for which the rejection is marginal (p-value close to 0.05), and Na and Ni, for which the results are inconclusive. This finding suggests that assuming no difference may result in biased results, and thus inaccurate constraints on characterising rocky planets around M dwarfs by scaling the (unmeasured) chemical abundances of planet-hosting M dwarfs from the chemical trends of [X/H]--[Fe/H] determined by GK dwarfs. Conclusions. It is therefore crucial for both the stellar and exoplanet communities to be aware of these observed differences. To better understand these differences, we advocate for dedicated modelling techniques for M-dwarf atmospheres and an increasing set of benchmark, homogeneous abundance analyses. Intermediately, our statistically constrained trends of [X/H]--[Fe/H] for M dwarfs provide a new constraint on estimating M-dwarf elemental abundances given measured [Fe/H] and further on characterising the detailed properties of M-dwarf-hosted rocky worlds.},

Planet c, and likely the other gas giant planets in the system, formed early on (likely within {$\sim$}1 Myr), followed by further atmospheric enrichment in C and O through the accretion of solids beyond the CO ice line.

  abstract = {A benchmark brown dwarf (BD) is a BD whose properties (e.g., mass and chemical composition) are precisely and independently measured. Benchmark BDs are valuable in testing theoretical evolutionary tracks, spectral synthesis, and atmospheric retrievals for substellar objects. Here, we report results of atmospheric retrieval on a synthetic spectrum and a benchmark BD, HR 7672 B, with petitRADTRANS. First, we test the retrieval framework on a synthetic PHOENIX BT-Settl spectrum with a solar composition. We show that the retrieved C and O abundances are consistent with solar values, but the retrieved C/O is overestimated by 0.13--0.18, which is about four times higher than the formal error bar. Second, we perform retrieval on HR 7672 B using high spectral-resolution data (R = 35,000) from the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer and near-infrared photometry. We retrieve [C/H], [O/H], and C/O to be -0.24 {\textpm} 0.05, -0.19 {\textpm} 0.04, and 0.52 {\textpm} 0.02. These values are consistent with those of HR 7672 A within 1.5{$\sigma$}. As such, HR 7672 B is among only a few benchmark BDs (along with Gl 570 D and HD 3651 B) that have been demonstrated to have consistent elemental abundances with their primary stars. Our work provides a practical procedure of testing and performing atmospheric retrieval, and sheds light on potential systematics of future retrievals using high- and low-resolution data.},

  abstract = {The development and evolution of a circumplanetary disk during the accretion of a giant planet is examined. The planet gains mass and angular momentum from infalling solar nebula material while simultaneously contracting due to luminosity losses. When the planet becomes rotationally unstable it begins to shed material into a circumplanetary disk. Viscosity causes the disk to spread to a moderate fraction of the Hill radius where it is assumed that a small fraction of the material escapes back into heliocentric orbit, carrying away most of the excess angular momentum. As the planet's contraction continues, its radius can become smaller than the spatial range of the inflow and material begins to fall directly onto the disk, which switches from a spin-out disk to an accretion disk as the planet completes its growth. We here develop a description of the circumplanetary disk, which is combined with models of the planet's contraction and the inflow rate including its angular momentum content to yield a solution for the time evolution of a planet--disk system.},

Recently, high-resolution cross-correlation analysis has emerged as a method of precisely constraining the C/O ratios of hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present two transits of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b observed between 1.4-2.4 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m with Gemini-S/IGRINS. We detected the presence of H\$\_\{2\}\$O, CO, and OH at signal-to-noise rations of 6.93, 6.47, and 3.90, respectively. We performed two retrievals on this data set. A free retrieval for abundances of these three species retrieved a volatile metallicity of \${\textbackslash}left[{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{C\}+{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\} \{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}\}{\textbackslash}right]=-0.70{\textasciicircum}\{+1.27\}\_\{-0.93\}\$, consistent with the stellar value, and a super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio of C/O\$=0.80{\textasciicircum}\{+0.07\}\_\{-0.11\}\$. We also ran a chemically self-consistent grid retrieval, which agreed with the free retrieval within \$1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ but favored a slightly more sub-stellar metallicity and solar C/O ratio (\${\textbackslash}left[{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{C\}+{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\} \{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}\}{\textbackslash}right]=-0.74{\textasciicircum}\{+0.23\}\_\{-0.17\}\$ and C/O\$=0.59{\textasciicircum}\{+0.13\}\_\{-0.14\}\$). A variety of formation pathways may explain the composition of WASP-76b. Additionally, we found systemic (\$V\_\{sys\}\$) and Keplerian (\$K\_\{p\}\$) velocity offsets which were broadly consistent with expectations from 3D general circulation models of WASP-76b, with the exception of a redshifted \$V\_\{sys\}\$ for H\$\_\{2\}\$O. Future observations to measure the phase-dependent velocity offsets and limb differences at high resolution on WASP-76b will be necessary to understand the H\$\_\{2\}\$O velocity shift. Finally, we find that the population of exoplanets with precisely constrained C/O ratios generally trends toward super-solar C/O ratios. More results from high-resolution observations or JWST will serve to further elucidate any population-level trends.},

We infer a limit log10 12C/13C {$>$} +0.37 (2{$\sigma$} ). We use the abundance pattern of this DLA, combined with a stochastic chemical enrichment model, to infer the properties of the enriching stars, finding the total gas mass of this system to be log10(Mgas/M ) = 6.3+-10..49 and the total stellar mass to be log10(M /M ) = 4.8 {\textpm} 1.3. The current observations disfavour enrichment by metal-poor asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with masses {$<$} 2.4 M , limiting the epoch at which this DLA formed most of its enriching stars. Our modelling suggests that this DLA formed very few stars until 1 Gyr after the cosmic reionization of hydrogen and, despite its very low metallicity ({$\sim$} 1/1000 of solar), this DLA appears to have formed most of its stars in the past few hundred Myr. Combining the inferred star formation history with evidence that some of the most metal-poor DLAs display an elevated [C/O] ratio at redshift z 3, we suggest that very metal-poor DLAs may have been affected by reionization quenching. Finally, given the simplicity and quiescence of the absorption features associated with the DLA studied here, we use these ESPRESSO data to place a bound on the possible variability of the fine-structure constant, {$\alpha$}/{$\alpha$} = (-1.2 {\textpm} 1.1) {\texttimes} 10-5.},

A period of several weeks is indicated by those spectra, which are best fit by a K2 V plus K5 V model. Further observations in 1994 March at Penn State's Black Moshannon Observatory (BMO), 1994 December and 1995 January at KPNO, and three archival KPNO spectra from 1988 January and 1992 November constrain the period to be 51.075{\textpm}0.018 days. The orbit of V773 Tau is eccentric and is seen at moderately high inclination, but probably not high enough for eclipses to occur. HR diagram placement and recent calculations of pre-main-sequence evolution suggest a mass ratio of about 1.78. While highly uncertain, this is higher than the dynamical mass ratio, \# = 1.32 {\textpm}0.06.

  abstract = {Retrieval methods are a powerful analysis technique for modelling exoplanetary atmospheres by estimating the bulk physical and chemical properties that combine in a forward model to best fit an observed spectrum, and they are increasingly being applied to observations of directly imaged exoplanets. We have adapted taurex3, the Bayesian retrieval suite, for the analysis of near-infrared spectrophotometry from directly imaged gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. We demonstrate taurex3's applicability to sub-stellar atmospheres by presenting results for brown dwarf benchmark GJ 570D which are consistent with previous retrieval studies, whilst also exhibiting systematic biases associated with the presence of alkali lines. We also present results for the cool exoplanet 51 Eri b, the first application of a free chemistry retrieval analysis to this object, using spectroscopic observations from GPI and SPHERE. While our retrieval analysis is able to explain spectroscopic and photometric observations without employing cloud extinction, we conclude this may be a result of employing a flexible temperature-pressure profile which is able to mimic the presence of clouds. We present Bayesian evidence for an ammonia detection with a 2.7{$\sigma$} confidence, the first indication of ammonia in a directly imaged exoplanetary atmosphere. This is consistent with this molecule being present in brown dwarfs of a similar spectral type. We demonstrate the chemical similarities between 51 Eri b and GJ 570D in relation to their retrieved molecular abundances. Finally, we show that overall retrieval conclusions for 51 Eri b can vary when employing different spectral data and modelling components, such as temperature--pressure and cloud structures.},

The observed sample consist of 13 Class I protostars and 22 Class II or transitional Class I/II stars; the Class I and I/II stars observed are all in systems that power Herbig-Haro flows. For 27 of these 35 stars, these measurements are the first high dispersion spectra ever obtained. Photospheric features are detected in 9 of the Class I stars and all of the Class II and I/II stars; strong emission lines (e.g. H-alpha) are detected in the spectra of all stars. These measurements are used to determine the stellar properties (effective temperatures, masses, relative surface gravities, rotational and radial velocities) and circumstellar properties (mass accretion and outflow rates) of this unprecedentedly young sample. Several Class I stars have spectral types cooler than M5 and therefore may be Class I brown dwarfs. The inferred masses of the Class I stars are, in several cases, significantly different from previous estimates derived by assuming an accretion dominated luminosity. The youngest stars (e.g. Class I-like) appear to have both higher mass accretion and outflow rates than older stars (e.g. Class II-like). Their rotational velocities, however, are not significantly different. The combined results are used to assess the validity of the popular Class I/II/III classification scheme as a measure of stellar age.},

  abstract = {We present high-resolution optical spectra obtained with the HIRES spectrograph on the W. M. Keck I Telescope of seven low-mass T Tauri stars (LMTTs) and brown dwarfs in Taurus-Auriga. The observed Li I 6708 {\AA} absorption, low surface gravity signatures, and radial velocities confirm that all are members of the Taurus star-forming region; no new spectroscopic binaries are identified. Four of the seven targets observed appear to be T Tauri brown dwarfs. Of particular interest is the previously classified "continuum T Tauri star" GM Tau, which has a spectral type of M6.5 and possibly a substellar mass. These spectra, in combination with previous high-resolution spectra of LMTTs, are used to understand the formation and early evolution of objects in Taurus-Auriga with masses near and below the stellar/substellar boundary. None of the LMTTs in Taurus are rapidly rotating (v sin i {$<$} 30 km s-1), unlike low-mass objects in Orion. Many of the slowly rotating, nonaccreting stars and brown dwarfs exhibit prominent H{$\alpha$} emission (equivalent widths of 3-36 {\AA}), indicative of active chromospheres. We demonstrate empirically that the full width at 10\% of the H{$\alpha$} emission profile peak is a more practical and possibly more accurate indicator of accretion than either the equivalent width of H{$\alpha$} or optical veiling: 10\% widths {$>$} 270 km s-1 are classical T Tauri stars (i.e., accreting), independent of stellar spectral type. Although LMTTs can have accretion rates comparable to that of more typical, higher mass T Tauri stars (e.g., K7-M0 spectral types), the average mass accretion rate appears to decrease with decreasing mass. A functional form of {\.M} {$\propto$} M is consistent with the available data, but the dependence is difficult to establish because of both selection biases in observed samples and the decreasing frequency of active accretion disks at low masses (M {$<$} 0.2 M{$\Sun$}). The diminished frequency of accretion disks for LMTTs, in conjunction with their lower, on average, mass accretion rates, implies that they are formed with less massive disks than higher mass T Tauri stars. The radial velocities, circumstellar properties, and known binaries do not support the suggestion that many of the lowest mass members of Taurus have been ejected from higher stellar density regions within the cloud. Instead, LMTTs appear to have formed and are evolving in the same way as higher mass T Tauri stars, but with smaller disks and shorter disk lifetimes.},

  abstract = {The Sun has a [Fe/H] metallicity which is larger by +0.17+/-0.04dex than the average metallicity of nearby stars of solar age. This result is derived from an age-metallicity relation based on the very accurate data published by Edvardsson et al. (1993A\&A...275..101E) for nearby F and G dwarfs. We adopt a radial galactic gradient in metallicity of d[Fe/H]/dR=-0.09+/-0.02 dex/kpc, independent of the age of the stars. From the solar anomaly and this galactic gradient, we derive that the Sun has been formed at a galactocentric distance R\_i,{$\odot\_$}=6.6+/-0.9kpc, if we adopt R\_0\_=8.5kpc for the present distance of the Sun from the galactic center. Hence the Sun has migrated from its birth-place in the inner part of the Galaxy outwards by 1.9 +/- 0.9 kpc during its lifetime of 4.5x10{\textasciicircum}9{\textasciicircum}years. This amount is in good agreement with predictions on the diffusion of stellar orbits in space which are based on the observed relation between velocity dispersion and age of nearby stars (i.e. on the diffusion in velocity space). The accurate determination of metallicities, coupled with a galactic gradient in metallicity, allows us to investigate empirically the diffusion of stellar orbits in space, at least in galactocentric distance. A direct consequence of this diffusion, and hence a good confirmation of it, is the increase in the dispersion of metallicities of nearby stars with increasing age. From such a relation, we derive also that the initial dispersion of metallicities is rather small. This is favourable for deriving the birth-place of the Sun from its anomaly in metallicity.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the present-day abundances of elements and isotopes, combined with model calculations, allow us to trace the history of nucleosynthesis in the universe. Throughout this review, emphasis will be placed on descriptions of the measurement processes and the interpretations needed to obtain actual isotope and element abundances from measurements. Comparisons of the abundances of isotopomers of a given element are less affected by systematic effects than are comparisons of the abundances of different elements. Thus ratios of isotopomers should be given a greater weight when data and models are compared. As is generally accepted, the universe began with an explosive event, the Big Bang. The nucleosynthesis associated with this event produced `primordial' abundances of the `light elements', deuterium, , , and . Subsequent stellar processing of the light elements has altered the relative abundances, and also produced heavier elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Stellar nucleosynthesis products from solar and larger mass stars are expelled into the interstellar medium (ISM). The goal of studies of the abundances of the light elements is to estimate the primordial abundances, that is, the abundances produced in the Big Bang. It is believed that D is always net destroyed in stars; and may be net produced, is certainly net produced. In the Solar System itself, results are obtained from in situ measurements with space probes to Jupiter, measurements of solar wind constituents, the analysis of the content of meteorites, and spectral line measurements of the solar photosphere. For sources outside the Solar System, these data are based on spectral line measurements of gas-phase species. The ratio of gas-phase abundances of elements, such as carbon to lithium may be affected by differing amounts of condensation onto dust grains; however such a process will not affect the ratio of isotopes such as . The most reliable measurements of D to H ratios are based on spectroscopic measurements of Lyman series ultraviolet absorption lines from foreground interstellar gas. Measurements of clouds in our galaxy have been obtained with satellites such as the International Ultraviolet Observatory, Copernicus, and the Hubble Space Telescope. The most interesting new development is the measurement of distant clouds with large redshifted velocities. Such data can be taken with Earth-bound optical telescopes. In the near future the Far Ultra Violet Explorer will refine and extend measurements of D/H ratios in relatively nearby regions. Abundances of in the ISM have been measured using the hyperfine transition of , in galactic H II regions which are ionized by high-mass stars. is the most abundant of the light elements. The primordial abundance must be very accurately determined if one wishes to use this quantity to estimate the baryon density in the early universe. Recently /H ratios have been measured in a number of metal-poor compact blue galaxies. These sources seem to have had little stellar evolution, so the ratio should be close to the primordial value. Estimates of the primordial abundance of are made for a population of old stars found far from the plane of our galaxy. A refinement of Li abundance estimates requires a more detailed understanding of the Li destruction processes in stars.},

  abstract = {Precise mass constraints are vital for the characterisation of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Here, we present how the combination of data obtained by Gaia and GRAVITY can help enlarge the sample of substellar companions with measured dynamical masses. We show how the Non-Single-Star (NSS) two-body orbit catalogue contained in Gaia DR3 can be used to inform high angular resolution follow-up observations with GRAVITY. Applying the method presented in this work for eight Gaia candidate systems, we detect all eight predicted companions, seven of which being previously unknown and five of substellar nature. Among the sample is Gaia DR3 2728129004119806464 B, which - detected at a angular separation of (34.01 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.15) mas from the host - is the closest substellar companion ever imaged. In combination with the system's distance this translates to a physical separation of (1.054 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.002) AU. The GRAVITY data are then used to break the host-companion mass degeneracy inherent to the Gaia NSS orbit solutions as well as to constrain the orbital solutions of the respective target systems. Knowledge of the companion masses enables us to further characterise them in terms of their age, effective temperature and radius by the application of evolutionary models. The results serve as an independent validation of the orbital solutions published in the NSS two-body orbit catalogue and show that the combination of astrometric survey missions and high-angular resolution direct imaging hold great promise for efficiently increasing the sample of directly-imaged companions in the future, especially in the light of the Gaia's upcoming DR4 and the advent of GRAVITY+.},

  abstract = {I report on a new component in the pre-main sequence multiple system V 773 Tauri. This second visual companion, V 773 Tau C, with a projected separation of {$\approx$}0. 2 has been detected using speckle interferometry in the near-infrared. Repeated observations from 1996 to 2002 show significant orbital motion and thus confirm the character of the new companion as a gravitationally bound star. Together with the two components of the spectroscopic binary V 773 Tau A and the previously known visual companion V 773 Tau B, the V 773 Tau system appears as a young ``mini-cluster'' of four T Tauri stars within a sphere of a radius less than 100 AU. V 773 Tau A, B and C form a triple system that is not hierarchic, but is apparently stable despite of this. The brightness of V 773 Tau C has probably increased over the last years, which may explain its non-detection in previous binary surveys.},

To understand the efficiency of cloud formation, it is therefore crucial to identify and quantify the replenishment mechanism that is able to compensate for these local losses of condensable elements in the upper atmosphere, and to keep the extrasolar weather cycle running. In this paper, we introduce a new cloud formation model by combining the cloud particle moment method we described previously with a diffusive mixing approach, taking into account turbulent mixing and gas-kinetic diffusion for both gas and cloud particles. The equations are of diffusion-reaction type and are solved time-dependently for a prescribed 1D atmospheric structure, until the model has relaxed toward a time-independent solution. In comparison to our previous models, the new hot-Jupiter model results (Teff {$\approx$} 2000 K, log g = 3) show fewer but larger cloud particles that are more concentrated towards the cloud base. The abundances of condensable elements in the gas phase are featured by a steep decline above the cloud base, followed by a shallower, monotonous decrease towards a plateau, the level of which depends on temperature. The chemical composition of the cloud particles also differs significantly from our previous models. Through the condensation of specific condensates such as Mg2SiO4[s] in deeper layers, certain elements, such as Mg, are almost entirely removed early from the gas phase. This leads to unusual (and non-solar) element ratios in higher atmospheric layers, which then favours the formation of SiO[s] and SiO2[s], for example, rather than MgSiO3[s].

  abstract = {DHTau is a young ({$\sim$}1 Myr) classical TTauri star. It is one of the few young PMS stars known to be associated with a planetary mass companion, DHTaub, orbiting at large separation and detected by direct imaging. DHTaub is thought to be accreting based on copious Ha emission and exhibits variable Paschen Beta emission. NOEMA observations at 230 GHz allow us to place constraints on the disk dust mass for both DHTaub and the primary in a regime where the disks will appear optically thin. We estimate a disk dust mass for the primary, DHTauA of 17.2  1.7 M{\AA}, which gives a disktostar mass ratio of 0.014 (assuming the usual gas todust mass ratio of 100 in the disk). We find a conservative disk dust mass upper limit of 0.42 M{$\oplus$} for DHTaub, assuming that the disk temperature is dominated by irradiation from DH Tau b itself. Given the environment of the circumplanetary disk, variable illumination from the primary or the equilibrium temperature of the surrounding cloud would lead to even lower disk mass estimates. AMCFOST radiative transfer model, including heating of the circumplanetary disk by DHTaub and DHTauA, suggests that a mass-averaged disk temperature of 22 K is more realistic, resulting in a dust disk mass upper limit of 0.09 M{$\oplus$} for DHTaub. We place DHTaub in context with similar objects and discuss the consequences for planet formation models.},

  abstract = {The first discovered extrasolar worlds---giant, ``hot Jupiter'' planets on short-period orbits---came as a surprise to solar system--centric models of planet formation, prompting the development of new theories for planetary system evolution. The near absence of observed nearby planetary companions to hot Jupiters has been widely quoted as evidence in support of high-eccentricity tidal migration, a framework in which hot Jupiters form further out in their natal protoplanetary disks before being thrown inward with extremely high eccentricities, stripping systems of any close-in planetary companions. In this work, we present new results from a search for transit timing variations across the full 4 yr Kepler data set, demonstrating that at least 12\% {\textpm} 6\% of hot Jupiters have a nearby planetary companion. This subset of hot Jupiters is expected to have a quiescent dynamical history such that the systems could retain their nearby companions. We also demonstrate a ubiquity of nearby planetary companions to warm Jupiters ({$\geq$}70\% {\textpm} 16\%), indicating that warm Jupiters typically form quiescently. We conclude by combining our results with existing observational constraints to propose an ``eccentric migration'' framework for the formation of short-period giant planets through postdisk dynamical sculpting in compact multiplanet systems. Our framework suggests that hot Jupiters constitute the natural end stage for giant planets spanning a wide range of eccentricities, with orbits that reach small enough periapses---either from their final orbital configurations in the disk phase or from eccentricity excitation in the postdisk phase---to trigger efficient tidal circularization.},

Stars in the same stellar associations as our systems have near-solar abundances, so these results indicate that this population of companions is consistent with formation via direct gravitational collapse. Alternatively, core accretion outside the CO snowline would be compatible with our measurements, though the high mass ratios of most systems would require rapid core assembly and gas accretion in massive disks. On a population level, our findings can be contrasted with abundance measurements for directly imaged planets with m{$<$}10 \$M\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{Jup\}\$, which show tentative atmospheric metal enrichment. In addition, the atmospheric compositions of our sample of companions are distinct from those of hot Jupiters, which most likely form via core accretion.

  abstract = {Direct imaging studies have mainly used low-resolution spectroscopy (R {$\sim$} 20--100) to study the atmospheres of giant exoplanets and brown dwarf companions, but the presence of clouds has often led to degeneracies in the retrieved atmospheric abundances (e.g., carbon-to-oxygen ratio, metallicity). This precludes clear insights into the formation mechanisms of these companions. The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) uses adaptive optics and single-mode fibers to transport light into NIRSPEC (R {$\sim$} 35,000 in the K band), and aims to address these challenges with high-resolution spectroscopy. Using an atmospheric retrieval framework based on petitRADTRANS, we analyze the KPIC high-resolution spectrum (2.29--2.49 {$\mu$}m) and the archival lowresolution spectrum (1--2.2 {$\mu$}m) of the benchmark brown dwarf HD 4747 B (m = 67.2 {\textpm} 1.8 MJup, a = 10.0 {\textpm} 0.2 au, Teff {$\approx$} 1400 K). We find that our measured C/O and metallicity for the companion from the KPIC high-resolution spectrum agree with those of its host star within 1{$\sigma$}--2{$\sigma$}. The retrieved parameters from the K-band high-resolution spectrum are also independent of our choice of cloud model. In contrast, the retrieved parameters from the low-resolution spectrum are highly sensitive to our chosen cloud model. Finally, we detect CO, H2O, and CH4 (volume-mixing ratio of log(CH4) = -4.82 {\textpm} 0.23) in this L/T transition companion with the KPIC data. The relative molecular abundances allow us to constrain the degree of chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of HD 4747 B, and infer a vertical diffusion coefficient that is at the upper limit predicted from mixing length theory.},

With an estimated mass of 8--22 MJup this object straddles the deuterium-burning limit, and might have formed via core or pebble accretion, disk instability, or molecular cloud fragmentation. To shed light on the formation history of DH Tau b, we obtain the first measurement of rotational line broadening for this object using high-resolution (R{$\sim$}25,000) near-infrared spectroscopy from Keck/NIRSPEC. We measure a projected rotational velocity (vsini) of 9.6{\textpm}0.7 km s-1, corresponding to a rotation rate that is between 9\% and 15\% of DH Tau b's predicted breakup speed. This low rotation rate is in good agreement with scenarios in which magnetic coupling between the companion and its circumplanetary disk during the late stages of accretion reduces angular momentum and regulates spin. We compare the rotation rate of DH Tau b to published values for other planetarymass objects with masses between 0.3 and 20 MJup and find no evidence of a correlation between mass and rotation rate in this mass regime. Finally, we search for evidence of individual molecules in DH Tau b's spectrum and find that it is dominated by CO and H2O, with no evidence of the presence of CH4. This agrees with expectations given DH Tau b's relatively high effective temperature ({$\sim$}2300 K).},

  abstract = {Complex organic molecules (COMs) in protoplanetary disks are key to understanding the origin of volatiles in comets in our solar system, yet the chemistry of COMs in protoplanetary disks remains poorly understood. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 3 observations of the disk around the young outbursting star V883 Ori, where the COMs sublimate from ices and are thus observable thanks to the warm condition of the disk. We have robustly identified ten oxygen-bearing COMs including 13C isotopologues in the disk-integrated spectra. The radial distributions of the COM emission, revealed by the detailed analyses of the line profiles, show the inner emission cavity, similar to the previous observations in Band 6 and Band 7. We found that the COMs abundance ratios with respect to methanol are significantly higher than those in the warm protostellar envelopes of IRAS 16293-2422 and similar to the ratios in the solar system comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, suggesting the efficient (re)formation of COMs in protoplanetary disks. We also constrained the 12C/13C and D/H ratios of COMs in protoplanetary disks for the first time. The 12C/13C ratios of acetaldehyde, methyl formate, and dimethyl ether are consistently lower ({$\sim$}20--30) than the canonical ratio in the interstellar medium ({$\sim$}69), indicating the efficient 13C-fractionation of CO. The D/H ratios of methyl formate are slightly lower than the values in IRAS 16293-2422, possibly pointing to the destruction and reformation of COMs in disks. We also discuss the implications for nitrogen and sulfur chemistry in protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are gas giants with very high equilibrium temperatures. In recent years, multiple chemical species, including various atoms and ions, have been discovered in their atmospheres. Most of these observations have been performed with transmission spectroscopy, although UHJs are also ideal targets for emission spectroscopy due to their strong thermal radiation. We present high-resolution thermal emission spectroscopy of the transiting UHJ KELT-20b/MASCARA-2b. The observation was performed with the CARMENES spectrograph at orbital phases before and after the secondary eclipse. We detected atomic Fe using the cross-correlation technique. The detected Fe lines are in emission, which unambiguously indicates a temperature inversion on the dayside hemisphere. We furthermore retrieved the temperature structure with the detected Fe lines. The result shows that the atmosphere has a strong temperature inversion with a temperature of \$4900{\textbackslash}pm\{700\}\$ K and a pressure of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4.8\_\{-1.1\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.0\}\}\$ bar at the upper layer of the inversion. A joint retrieval of the CARMENES data and the TESS secondary eclipse data returns a temperature of \$2550\_\{-250\}{\textasciicircum}\{+150\}\$ K and a pressure of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-1.5\_\{-0.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}\}\$ bar at the lower layer of the temperature inversion. The detection of such a strong temperature inversion is consistent with theoretical simulations that predict an inversion layer on the dayside of UHJs. The joint retrieval of the CARMENES and TESS data demonstrates the power of combing high-resolution emission spectroscopy with secondary eclipse photometry in characterizing atmospheric temperature structures.},

Although such inversion layers have recently been observed in several ultra-hot Jupiters, the chemical species responsible for creating the inversion remain unidentified. Here, we present observations of the thermal emission spectrum of an ultra-hot Jupiter, WASP-189b, at high spectral resolution using the HARPS-N spectrograph. Using the cross-correlation technique, we detect a strong Fe i signal. The detected Fe i spectral lines are found in emission, which is direct evidence of a temperature inversion in the planetary atmosphere. We further performed a retrieval on the observed spectrum using a forward model with an MCMC approach. When assuming a solar metallicity, the best-fit result returns a temperature of 4320+-112000 K at the top of the inversion, which is significantly hotter than the planetary equilibrium temperature (2641 K). The temperature at the bottom of the inversion is determined as 2200+-1800000 K. Such a strong temperature inversion is probably created by the absorption of atomic species like Fe i.},

  abstract = {Recent measurements of carbon isotope ratios in both protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres have suggested a possible transfer of significant carbon isotope fractionation from disks to planets. For a clearer understanding of the isotopic link between disks and planets, it is important to measure the carbon isotope ratios in various species. In this paper, we present a detection of the \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CN \$N=2-1\$ hyperfine lines in the TW Hya disk with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This is the first spatially-resolved detection of \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CN in disks, which enables us to measure the spatially resolved \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CN/\${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CN ratio for the first time. We conducted non-local thermal equilibrium modeling of the \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CN lines in conjunction with previously observed \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CN lines to derive the kinetic temperature, \$\{{\textbackslash}rm H\_2\}\$ volume density, and column densities of \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CN and \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CN. The \$\{{\textbackslash}rm H\_2\}\$ volume density is found to range between \$ (4 - 10){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}7 {\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}\$, suggesting that CN molecules mainly reside in the disk upper layer. The \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CN/\${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CN ratio is measured to be \$ 70{\textasciicircum}\{+9\}\_\{-6\}\$ at \$30 {$<$} r {$<$} 80\$ au from the central star, which is similar to the \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{12\}C/{\textasciicircum}\{13\}C\$ ratio in the interstellar medium. However, this value differs from the previously reported values found for other carbon-bearing molecules (CO and HCN) in the TW Hya disk. This could be self-consistently explained by different emission layer heights for different molecules combined with preferential sequestration of \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{12\}C\$ into the solid phase towards the disk midplane. This study reveals the complexity of the carbon isotope fractionation operating in disks.},

  abstract = {Planetary systems are thought to be born in protoplanetary disks. Isotope ratios are a powerful tool for investigating the material origin and evolution from molecular clouds to planetary systems via protoplanetary disks. However, it is challenging to measure the isotope (isotopologue) ratios, especially in protoplanetary disks, because the emission lines of major species are saturated. We developed a new method to overcome these challenges by using optically thin line wings induced by thermal broadening. As a first application of the method, we analyzed two carbon monoxide isotopologue lines, 12CO 3--2 and 13CO 3--2, from archival observations of a protoplanetary disk around TW Hya with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The 12CO/13CO ratio was estimated to be 21 {\textpm} 5 at disk radii of 70--110 au, which is significantly smaller than the value observed in the local interstellar medium, {$\sim$}69. It implies that an isotope exchange reaction occurs in a low-temperature environment with C/ O {$>$} 1. In contrast, it is suggested that 12CO/13CO is higher than {$\sim$}84 in the outer disk (r {$>$} 130 au), which can be explained by the difference in the binding energy of the isotopologues on dust grains and the CO gas depletion processes. Our results imply that the gas-phase 12CO/13CO can vary by a factor of {$>$}4 even inside a protoplanetary disk and therefore can be used to trace material evolution in disks.},

The stars are separated into metal-poor ([Fe/H]~\&lt;~-0.2\,dex and metal-rich ([Fe/H]~\&gt;~-0.2\,dex) groups, so that the metal-rich stars are mostly {$\alpha$}-poor, while the metal-poor group are mostly contributed by {$\alpha$}-enhanced stars. Thus, the old and metal-poor stars likely belong to the chemically defined thick disc population, while the metal-rich sample is dominated by the thin disc. The AVR for the metal-poor sample shows an abrupt increase at {$\greaterequivlnt$}7\,Gyr, which is contributed by the thick disc component. On the other hand, most of the thin disc stars with [Fe/H]~\&gt;~-0.2\,dex display a power-law-like AVR with indices of about 0.3--0.4 and 0.5 for the in-plane and vertical dispersions, respectively. This is consistent with the scenario that the disc is gradually heated by the spiral arms and/or the giant molecular clouds. Moreover, the older thin disc stars (\&gt;7\,Gyr) have a rounder velocity ellipsoid, i.e. {$\sigma\phi$}/{$\sigma$}z is close to 1.0, probably due to the more efficient heating in vertical direction. Particularly for the old metal-poor sample located with {\textbar}z{\textbar}~\&gt;~270\,pc, the vertical dispersion is even larger than its azimuthal counterpart. Finally, the vertex deviations and the tilt angles are plausibly around zero with large uncertainties.},

The ab initio PE and coupling curves, computed at the multireference configuration interaction level of theory, were refined by fitting their analytical representations to 2617 experimentally derived SiO energy levels determined from 97 vibronic bands belonging to the X--X,~E--X, and A--X electronic systems through the MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational--Vibrational Energy Levels) procedure. 112 observed forbidden transitions from the C--X,~D--X,~e--X, and d--X bands were assigned using our predictions, and these could be fed back into the MARVEL procedure.

The revision is motivated by the recent experimental measurements and astrophysical findings involving the highly excited rotational states of AlH in its A 1{$\Pi$} - X 1{$\Sigma$}+ system. A new high-resolution emission spectrum of 10 bands from the A 1{$\Pi$} - X 1{$\Sigma$}+ system of AlD, in the region 17\,300--32\,000~cm-1 was recorded with a Fourier transform spectrometer, which probes the predissociative A 1{$\Pi$} v~= 2 state. The AlD new line positions are combined with all available experimental data on AlH and AlD to construct a comprehensive set of empirical rovibronic energies of AlH and AlD covering the X 1{$\Sigma$}+ and A 1{$\Pi$} electronic states using the MARVEL approach. We then refine the spectroscopic model WYLLoT to our experimentally derived energies using the nuclear-motion code Duo and use this fit to produce improved line lists for 27AlH, 27AlD, and 26AlH with a better coverage of the rotationally excited states of A 1{$\Pi$} in the predissociative energy region. The lifetimes of the predissociative states are estimated and are included in the line list using the new ExoMol data structure, alongside the temperature-dependent continuum contribution to the photoabsorption spectra of AlH. The new line lists are shown to reproduce the experimental spectra of both AlH and AlD well, and to describe the AlH absorption in the recently reported Proxima Cen spectrum, including the strong predissociative line broadening. The line lists are included into the ExoMol data base www.exomol.com.},

  abstract = {The spectra of brown dwarfs are key to exploring the chemistry and physics that take place in their atmospheres. Late-T dwarf spectra are particularly diagnostic, due to their relatively cloud-free atmospheres and deep molecular bands. With the use of powerful atmospheric retrieval tools applied to the spectra of these objects, direct constraints on molecular/atomic abundances, gravity, and vertical thermal profiles can be obtained, enabling a broad exploration of the chemical/physical mechanisms operating in their atmospheres. We present a uniform retrieval analysis on low-resolution Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX near-infrared spectra for a sample of 50 T dwarfs, including new observations as part of a recent volume-limited survey. This analysis more than quadruples the sample of T dwarfs with retrieved temperature profiles and abundances (H2O, CH4, NH3, K, and subsequent C/O and metallicities). We are generally able to constrain the effective temperatures to within 50 K, the volume mixing ratios for major species to within 0.25 dex, the atmospheric metallicities [M/H] to within 0.2, and the C/O ratios to within 0.2. We compare our retrieved constraints on the thermal structures, chemistry, and gravities of these objects with predictions from self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium models and find, in general, though with substantial scatter, consistency with solar composition chemistry and the thermal profiles of the neighboring stellar FGK population. Objects with notable discrepancies between the two modeling techniques and potential mechanisms for their differences, be they related to the modeling approach or physically motivated, are discussed more thoroughly in the text.},

  abstract = {We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second release of the Gaia mission (Gaia DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration of the star-forming regions within 500 pc of the Sun. By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (uppermain sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, G-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new open cluster towards l, b {$\sim$} 218.5{\textopenbullet}, -2{\textopenbullet}, which could be related to the Orion star-forming complex. We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.},

Its C/O We retrieve an ratio of {$\sim$}0.56 isotopologue 12CO/13CO ratio of is consistent with the solar value. 97+-2158 (90\% uncertainty), marginally higher than the local interstellar Conclusions. Although only one super-Jupiter and one brown dwarf now have a measured 12CO/13CO ratio, it is intriguing that they are different, possibly hinting to distinct formation pathways. Regardless of spectroscopic similarities, isolated brown dwarfs may experience a top-down formation via gravitational collapse, which resembles star formation, while giant exoplanets favourably form through core accretion, which potentially alters isotopologue ratios in their atmospheres depending on the material they accrete from protoplanetary disks. This further emphasises atmospheric carbon isotopologue ratio as a tracer of the formation history of exoplanets. In the future, analyses such as those presented here should be conducted on a wide range of exoplanets using medium-to-high-resolution spectroscopy to further assess planet formation processes.},

  abstract = {Young, self-luminous super-Jovian companions discovered by direct imaging provide a challenging test of planet formation and evolution theories. By spectroscopically characterizing the atmospheric compositions of these super-Jupiters, we can constrain their formation histories. Here we present studies of the recently discovered HIP 99770 b, a 16 MJup high-contrast companion on a 17 au orbit, using the fiber-fed high-resolution spectrograph KPIC (R {$\sim$} 35, 000) on the Keck II telescope. Our K-band observations led to detections of H2O and CO in the atmosphere of HIP 99770 b. We carried out free retrieval analyses using petitRADTRANS to measure its chemical abundances, including the metallicity and C/O ratio, projected rotation velocity (v sin i), and radial velocity (RV). We found that the companion's atmosphere has C/O = 0.55+-00..0064 and [M/H] = 0.26+-00..2243 (1{$\sigma$} confidence intervals), values consistent with those of the Sun and with a companion formation via gravitational instability or core accretion. The projected rotation velocity v sin(i) {$<$} 7.8 km s-1 is small relative to other directly imaged companions with similar masses and ages. This may imply a near pole-on orientation or effective magnetic braking by a circumplanetary disk. In addition, we added the companion-toprimary relative RV measurement to the orbital fitting and obtained updated constraints on orbital parameters. Detailed characterization of super-Jovian companions within 20 au like HIP 99770 b is critical for understanding the formation histories of this population.},

We have studied the atmospheric properties of COCONUTS-2b using newly acquired 1.0--2.5{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu\$m spectroscopy from Gemini/Flamingos-2. The spectral type of COCONUTS-2b is refined to T\$9.5 {\textbackslash}pm 0.5\$ based on comparisons with T/Y dwarf spectral templates. We have conducted an extensive forward-modeling analysis, comparing the near-infrared spectrum and mid-infrared broadband photometry with sixteen state-of-the-art atmospheric model grids developed for brown dwarfs and self-luminous exoplanets near the T/Y transition. The {\textbackslash}texttt\{PH\$\_\{3\}\$-free ATMO2020++\}, {\textbackslash}texttt\{ATMO2020++\}, and {\textbackslash}texttt\{Exo-REM\} models best match the specific observations of COCONUTS-2b, regardless of variations in the input spectrophotometry. This analysis suggests the presence of disequilibrium chemistry, along with a diabatic thermal structure and/or clouds, in the atmosphere of COCONUTS-2b. All models predict fainter \$Y\$-band fluxes than observed, highlighting uncertainties in the alkali chemistry models and opacities. We determine a bolometric luminosity of \${\textbackslash}log\{(L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bol\}/L\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\})\}=-6.18\$ dex, with a 0.5 dex-wide range of \$[-6.43,-5.93]\$ dex that accounts for various assumptions of models. Using thermal evolution models, we derive an effective temperature of \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}=483{\textasciicircum}\{+44\}\_\{-53\}\$ K, a surface gravity of \${\textbackslash}log\{(g)\}=4.19{\textasciicircum}\{+0.18\}\_\{-0.13\}\$ dex, a radius of \$R=1.11{\textasciicircum}\{+0.03\}\_\{-0.04\}\$ R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$, and a mass of \$M=8 {\textbackslash}pm 2\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$. Various atmospheric model grids consistently indicate that COCONUTS-2b's atmosphere has sub- or near-solar metallicity and C/O. These findings provide valuable insights into COCONUTS-2b's formation history and the potential outward migration to its current wide orbit.},

We present an in-depth analysis of the atmospheric composition of the star and planet to probe the planet's formation pathway. Based on new high-resolution spectroscopy of AF Lep A, we measure a uniform set of stellar parameters and elemental abundances (e.g., [Fe/H] = -0.27 {\textpm} 0.31 dex). The planet's dynamical mass ( \$\{2.8\}\_\{-0.5\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.6\}\$ M Jup) and orbit are also refined using published radial velocities, relative astrometry, and absolute astrometry. We use petitRADTRANS to perform chemically consistent atmospheric retrievals for AF Lep b. The radiative-convective equilibrium temperature profiles are incorporated as parameterized priors on the planet's thermal structure, leading to a robust characterization for cloudy self-luminous atmospheres. This novel approach is enabled by constraining the temperature-pressure profiles via the temperature gradient \$(d{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ln\}T/d{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ln\}P)\$ , a departure from previous studies that solely modeled the temperature. Through multiple retrievals performed on different portions of the 0.9-4.2 {$\mu$}m spectrophotometry, along with different priors on the planet's mass and radius, we infer that AF Lep b likely possesses a metal-enriched atmosphere ([Fe/H] {$>$} 1.0 dex). AF Lep b's potential metal enrichment may be due to planetesimal accretion, giant impacts, and/or core erosion. The first process coincides with the debris disk in the system, which could be dynamically excited by AF Lep b and lead to planetesimal bombardment. Our analysis also determines T eff {$\approx$} 800 K, \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}(g){\textbackslash}approx 3.7\$ dex, and the presence of silicate clouds and disequilibrium chemistry in the atmosphere. Straddling the L/T transition, AF Lep b is thus far the coldest exoplanet with suggested evidence of silicate clouds.},

We carry out free atmospheric retrieval analyses to constrain chemical and isotopic abundances, temperature structures, rotation velocities, and radial velocities. We confirm the previous detection of 13CO in YSES 1 b at a higher significance of 12.6\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}, but point to a higher 12CO/13CO ratio of 88+/-13 (1\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} confidence interval), consistent with the primary's isotope ratio 66+/-5. We retrieve a solar-like composition in YSES 1 b with a C/O=0.57+/-0.01, indicating a formation via gravitational instability or core accretion beyond the CO iceline. Additionally, the observations lead to detections of H2O and CO in the outer planet YSES 1 c at 7.3\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} and 5.7\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}, respectively. We constrain the atmospheric C/O ratio of YSES 1 c to be either solar or subsolar (C/O=0.36+/-0.15), indicating the accretion of oxygen-rich solids. The two companions have distinct vsini, 5.34+/-0.14 km/s for YSES 1 b and 11.3+/-2.1 km/s for YSES 1 c, despite their similar natal environments. This may indicate different spin axis inclinations or effective magnetic braking by the long-lived circumplanetary disk around YSES 1 b.

We investigate observationally the early stages of formation of a stellar cluster in a massive filamentary infrared dark cloud, G28.34+0.06 P1, in the 1.3 mm continuum and spectral line emission using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array. Sensitive continuum data reveal further fragmentation in five dusty cores at a resolution of several 103 AU. Spectral line emission from C18O, CH3OH, 13CS, H2CO, and N2D+ is detected for the first time toward these dense cores. We found that three cores are chemically more evolved as compared with the other two; interestingly, though, all of them are associated with collimated outflows as suggested by evidence from the CO, SiO, CH3OH, H2CO, and SO emission. The parsec-scale kinematics in exhibit velocity gradients along the filament, consistent with accretion flows toward the clumps and cores. The moderate luminosity and the chemical signatures indicate that the five cores harbor low- to intermediate-mass protostars that likely become massive ones at the end of the accretion. Despite the fact that the mass limit reached by the dust continuum sensitivity is 30 times lower than the thermal Jeans mass, there is a lack of a distributed low-mass protostellar population in the clump. Our observations indicate that in a protocluster, low-mass stars form at a later stage after the birth of more massive protostars.},

  abstract = {PyExoCross is a Python adaptation of the ExoCross Fortran application (Yurchenko, A\&amp;A, 614, A131 (2018)). PyExoCross is designed for postprocessing the huge molecular line lists generated by the ExoMol project and other similar initiatives such as the HITRAN and HITEMP databases. PyExoCross generates absorption and emission stick spectra, cross sections~and other properties (partition functions, specific heats, cooling functions, lifetimes and oscillator strengths) based on molecular line lists. PyExoCross calculates cross sections~with four line profiles: Doppler, Gaussian, Lorentzian and Voigt profiles in both sampling and binned methods; a number of options are available for computing Voigt profiles which we test for speed and accuracy. PyExoCross supports importing and exporting line lists in the ExoMol and HITRAN/HITEMP formats. PyExoCross also provides conversion between the ExoMol and HITRAN data format. In addition, PyExoCross has extra code for users to automate the batch download of line list files from the ExoMol database.},

  abstract = {We present a forward-modeling framework using the Bayesian inference tool Starfish and cloudless Sonora-Bobcat model atmospheres to analyze low-resolution (R {$\approx$} 80-250) near-infrared (1.0-2.5 {$\mu$}m) spectra of T dwarfs. Our approach infers effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, radii, and masses, and by accounting for uncertainties from model interpolation and correlated residuals due to instrumental effects and modeling systematics, produces more realistic parameter posteriors than traditional ({$\chi$}2-based) spectral-fitting analyses. We validate our framework by fitting the model atmospheres themselves and finding negligible offsets between derived and input parameters. We apply our methodology to three well-known benchmark late-T dwarfs, HD 3651B, GJ 570D, and Ross 458C, using both solar and nonsolar metallicity atmospheric models. We also derive these benchmarks' physical properties using their bolometric luminosities, their primary stars' ages and metallicities, and Sonora-Bobcat evolutionary models. Assuming the evolutionary-based parameters are more robust, we find our atmospheric-based, forward-modeling analysis produces two outcomes. For HD 3615B and GJ 570D, spectral fits provide accurate Teff and R but underestimated \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}g\$ (by {$\approx$}1.2 dex) and Z (by {$\approx$}0.35 dex), likely due to the systematics from modeling the potassium line profiles. For Ross 458C, spectral fits provide accurate \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}g\$ and Z but overestimated Teff (by {$\approx$}120 K) and underestimated R (by {$\approx$}1.6{\texttimes}), likely because our model atmospheres lack clouds, reduced vertical temperature gradients, or disequilibrium processes. Finally, the spectroscopically inferred masses of these benchmarks are all considerably underestimated.},

Recent measurements of 12CO/13CO abundance ratios in the atmosphere of the young super-Jupiter YSES-1b and the isolated brown dwarf 2MASS J03552337+1133437 may point to distinct formation pathways. Here we present our analysis of 0.5 hr of science verification observations using the recently upgraded CRIRES spectrograph at ESO's Very Large Telescope on the same brown dwarf, with the aim to detect C18O and determine the 16O/18O isotope ratio. Our free retrieval analyses confirm the previous measurement of the carbon isotope ratio, and the inclusion of the C18O molecule in our models enables an initial tentative constraint of 16O/18O = on the oxygen isotope ratio, but this requires more data to be confirmed. These short observations showcase the prospect of studying the isotope inventory in brown dwarfs and super-Jovian exoplanets with high-dispersion spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {SDSS J010448.46+153501.8 has previously been classified as an sdM9.5 subdwarf. However, its very blue J - K colour (--0.15 {\textpm} 0.17) suggests a much lower metallicity compared to normal sdM9.5 subdwarfs. Here, we re-classify this object as a usdL1.5 subdwarf based on a new optical and near-infrared spectrum obtained with X-shooter on the Very Large Telescope. Spectral fitting with BT-Settl models leads to Teff = 2450 {\textpm} 150 K, [Fe/H] = --2.4 {\textpm} 0.2 and log g = 5.5 {\textpm} 0.25. We estimate a mass for SDSS J010448.46+153501.8 of 0.086 {\textpm} 0.0015 M which is just below the hydrogen-burning minimum mass at [Fe/H] = --2.4 ({$\sim$}0.088 M ) according to evolutionary models. Our analysis thus shows SDSS J010448.46+153501.8 to be the most metal-poor and highest mass substellar object known to-date. We found that SDSS J010448.46+153501.8 is joined by another five known L subdwarfs (2MASS J05325346+8246465, 2MASS J06164006-6407194, SDSS J125637.16-022452.2, ULAS J151913.03-000030.0 and 2MASS J16262034+3925190) in a `halo brown dwarf transition zone' in the Teff--[Fe/H] plane, which represents a narrow mass range in which unsteady nuclear fusion occurs. This halo brown dwarf transition zone forms a `substellar subdwarf gap' for mid L to early T types.},

  abstract = {Measurements of accretion rates onto planetary mass objects may distinguish between different planet formation mechanisms, which predict different accretion histories. In this Letter, we use Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 UVIS optical photometry to measure accretion rates onto three accreting objects, GSC 06214-00210 b, GQ Lup b, and DH Tau b, that are at the planet/brown dwarf boundary and are companions to solar mass stars. The excess optical emission in the excess accretion continuum yields mass accretion rates of 10-9--10-11 M{$\Sun$} yr-1 for these three objects. Their accretion rates are an order of magnitude higher than expected from the correlation between mass and accretion rates measured from the UV excess, which is applicable if these wide planetary mass companions formed by protostellar core fragmentation. The high accretion rates and large separation from the central star demonstrate the presence of massive disks around these objects. Models for the formation and evolution of wide planetary mass companions should account for their large accretion rates. High ratios of H{$\alpha$} luminosity over accretion luminosity for objects with low accretion rates suggest that searches for H{$\alpha$} emission may be an efficient way to find accreting planets.},

A Circumplanetary disks only accreting at moderately accreting circumplanetary 10-10 M disk (M˙ yr-1 around a 1 {$\sim$} 10-8 M yr-1 MJ planet can be brighter than the ; enough to form a 10 MJ planet planet within 1 Myr) around a 1 MJ planet has a maximum temperature of {$\sim$}2000 K, and at near-infrared wavelengths (J, H, K bands), this disk is as bright as a late-M-type brown dwarf or a 10 MJ planet with a ``hot start.'' To use direct imaging to find the accretion disks around low-mass planets (e.g., 1 MJ) and distinguish them from brown dwarfs or hot high-mass planets, it is crucial to obtain photometry at mid-infrared bands (L , M, N bands) because the emission from circumplanetary disks falls off more slowly toward longer wavelengths than those of brown dwarfs or planets. If young planets have strong magnetic fields ( 100 G), fields may truncate slowly accreting circumplanetary disks (M˙ 10-9 M yr-1) and lead to magnetospheric accretion, which can provide additional accretion signatures, such as UV/optical excess from the accretion shock and line emission.},
