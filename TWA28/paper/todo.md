## TODO
* [ ] Color-magnitude diagram with mass from evolutionary models
* Fig 1. full spectrum range showing best-fit model
** show individual contribution from disk and from photosphere

* Combine results from CRIRES+?
* Convolve down model from CRIRES+ to NIRSPec to compare both best-fit models

* MId-IR photometry, spitzer?
