## Retrievals of M dwarfs
- [ ] Fit orders 47, 48 with CO and H2O
- [ ] Recompute opacities to 5000 K
    - [ ] Na, K, ...?


## Gl 880
- [ ] J band orders: 30,31,32
    - Missing opacity: Fe, Mg, Cr, Sc
- [ ] K band orders: 45,46,47,48
    - Missing opacity: Isotopologues of CO, H2O? Fe, Mg, U
    - [ ] Implement matching vertical profile of H2(18)O to H2O
